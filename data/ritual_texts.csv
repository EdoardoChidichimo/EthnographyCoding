1,"Ritual occurs in preparation for the Sun Dance Festival. It is necessary for a woman to qualify for the office of medicine woman for the Sun Dance otherwise the ceremony cannot occur. The woman generally qualifies by a vow. Of times, when a member of the family is dangerously ill, one of the women goes out of the tipi and raising her eyes to the sun calls upon it that health may be restored to the ailing one. In such an appeal she offers to make gifts to the sun, usually specifying that she will sacrifice a piece of cloth, a dress, a robe, an ax, etc., which are after a time, provided the sick one improves, hung in trees or deposited upon a hill. Such appeals are still made with great frequency. It is believed that unless the woman has been industrious, truthful, and above all, true to her marriage vows, her appeal will not be answered. Sometimes, when the woman addresses the sun she promises to be the medicine woman at the next sun dance. She herself may be ill and promise such a sacrifice in case she receives help. Again, she may, out of gratitude for the satisfactory way in which her prayers have been answered, announce her intention to take this step. In such a case, a formal announcement is made to the sun. In company with a man, usually a medicine man experienced in the ceremonies, she steps out into the camp, where they face the sun whom the man addresses, explaining that as this woman asked for help in time of need and that inasmuch as it was granted, she in turn promises to be the medicine woman at the first opportunity. Some such formal announcement is made in every case where the prayers have been answered. By this formality, the vow receives public registry."
2,"Ceremony of the tongues. Woman asks for help from gods and promises to become a medicine woman at first opportunity, if her prayers are answered she becomes obligated to organize this ritual at the beginning of the sun dance. She must perform the medicine woman’s functions, it is literally an obligation to purchase a natoas bundle, or if already the owner of a bundle, to perform its ritual. Other women who have received help from god and vowed to participate are involved in skinning tongues"
3,"The Hundred-Willow Sweat House. The procession from the medicine woman’s tipi consists of the father and another man experienced in ceremonial affairs, the husband, the mother and the medicine woman. They approach slowly and by stages, passing around the south side of the sweathouse to the north and then to the east or entrance. All keep their eyes on the ground. The husband walks with a heavy staff; the medicine woman carries the natoas bundle with a smudge stick. The men enter the sweathouse, while the two women go to the west side and sit down facing the east. The medicine woman is on the north side with the bundle before her. After the men have entered, the fire is lighted and some of the attendants (builders of the sweathouse) lift the buffalo skull to the top of the sweathouse where it faces the east. Prayers and the usual sweathouse procedure now follow while the stones and a pail of water are passed in by an attendant. The covers are then drawn down and the vapor bath taken. After the ceremony the procession returns to the medicine woman’s tipi. The cover is removed from the sweathouse and the buffalo skull placed on top where it remains."

5,"The cutting of the sun pole is attended with some ceremony. Some informants claim that formerly this was to be carried out by the medicine woman’s band; others that one of the men’s societies was called upon for this service. In any event, they go out as a war party and locate a suitable tree. A man with a war record, preferably one having struck an enemy with an ax, comes forward, takes an ax, paints the blade as he recounts some event in which he killed an enemy, and then strikes the tree. Four such deeds must be told before the tree can be felled. Then one or two men cut the tree as the others stand around. As the tree begins to fall all give the war cry and shoot at its top, then rush up, and tearing off branches, wave them in the air as if they were trophies from an enemy. Indeed, the whole proceeding, from start to finish, is a mimic attack on an enemy. The pole is cut to approximate form and taken to the site of the dancing lodge. One end is placed on a travois (in recent times on a wagon), while the riders assist with their ropes, their horses massed around the travois horse. The hole for the sun pole is dug without ceremony by relatives of the medicine woman."
6,"Raising the Sun Pole. About time for the sun to set, a procession of pole raisers starts from each of the four quarters of the camp circle. Tipi poles are tied near the small ends in pairs, each pair carried by two men. The four parties advance in unison by four stages and at each pause sing a special song. In the last move, they rush upon the sun pole and raise it in place. In the meantime, the father and son go and stand on the center pole while their wives stand to the west. The men make wing movements with their arms toward the east. According to some informants, the medicine woman may make hooking motions at the pole, to symbolize the mythical Elk-woman. Four men are called upon to assist the father and son. As the latter stand upon the pole, they encircle and screen them with their blankets and join the father in singing. The songs call for good luck in erecting the dancing lodge. The son does not sing. Four songs are sung. At the end of each the father blows a whistle while someone shakes the pole. The last time they jump off the pole. The son drops his blanket (some say the father also, some add moccasins) painted black as a sun offering. Another blanket is handed him at once. As soon as the men leave the pole the advancing raisers rush in, raise the center pole, put on the rafters, tie them with the rawhide strands and place brush all around to form the wind-break. This is accompanied by much shouting, but without shooting. While the sun pole is being raised the daughter and mother stand watching it. They pray and make movements with the corners of their robes as though steering the rising pole. As it sways from side to side, they gesture as if righting it. As soon as the pole is set, the natoas, robe, and moccasins are taken off the daughter by the mother. She may call on someone to do this and pay a gun or a horse for the service. The mother and other attendants then lead the daughter to her tipi where she resumes her ordinary routine. The father and son go to a sweathouse where all the paint is washed off. This is not the hundred-willow sweathouse and is the fifth sweathouse, if it were counted. The two men go in and some sagegrass being handed to the father, he takes off the feathers tied to the son’s hair, the hair necklace, and whistle. After the first opening of the sweathouse he takes the sagegrass and wipes off the black paint on the son and hands out through the west side of the sweathouse the necklace, whistle, and feathers which are to be taken home. At the same time, the two women are in the ceremonial lodge, the mother caring for the daughter."
7,"Weather dance, dancers aim to control the weather. Early on the fifth day, a booth is built inside the dancing lodge opposite the entrance. A slight excavation about six feet square is made over which is erected a shelter of green cottonwood boughs, open on the side facing the sun pole. Before the middle of the day, a procession of one or more men supposed to have power over the weather, attended by drummers, proceeds by stages from the medicine woman’s tipi to this booth. They pause four times and dance, facing alternately the east and the west. They hold whistles of bone in their mouths, which are sounded in unison with the dancing. The procession is of two transverse lines, the dancers, in front, the drummers and singers behind. A great deal of dancing is done between the entrance to the dancing lodge and the booth. At intervals during the day they stand before the booth and dance to the east and west: the drummers are now stationed on the south side of the booth where women also assemble for the singing. The dancing is chiefly an up and down movement produced by flexing the knees, the eyes are directed toward the sun and wing-like movements of the hands are made in the same direction. The dancers wear breechcloth and moccasins and usually a robe around the waist. Their faces and bodies are painted according to their own medicines and medicine objects worn on their heads. During the days they are in the booth, individuals come to them “to be prayed for.” They come up and stand before the booth. The dancer takes black paint and paints their faces. Then he prays to the sun for their welfare. During this part of the ceremony the recipient faces the sun. Again, the medicine-pipes and other ritualistic objects are brought up for the dancer to present to the sun. The pipes he holds up with the stems towards the sun, whom he addresses at some length, offering him a smoke, making requests, etc., after which he smokes the pipe. All the persons present are then permitted to put their lips to the pipe from which they are supposed to derive great benefits. The dancer also receives offerings made to the sun. A young man may fill a pipe and approach with his offerings. The dancer takes the pipe, smokes, prays, paints the man’s face, and makes the offering. A woman or child may do this; or a whole family. Formerly, a great deal of old clothing was offered at this time, a custom still practiced by the Blood. Also children’s moccasins and clothing were offered in this way. As they grew out of them they were given to the sun to promote well-being."
8,Sun god ceremony involving pulling a skewer from chest. Participant gives himself to sun god and enters special group of warriors. Sometimes this ceremony is performed if a patient has vowed to undergo it after the sun god has granted a request
9,"During times of need or mourning, warriors (or other people) sometimes cut a piece of skin from their body, or remove a digit from a finger. This ois offered to the Sun God. For example: 'George Strangling Wolf, while praying, took a needle out of his “housewife” (a soldier‘s name for a sewing kit) and inserted it into the skin near his knee. He then took an army knife and sliced off that portion of the flesh which he was holding out taut with the needle. Pointing in the direction of the sun, and still holding the small portion of bloody flesh in his hand, George offered the following prayer: Help me, Sun, to survive this terrible war, that I may meet my relatives again. With this request, I offer you my body as food'. He then dug a small hole in the ground with his finger and buried the bloody thing he was holding. Strangling Wolf was a strong adherent to the ancient beliefs of his forefathers."
10,"Ritual of Assembly involving camel sacrifice, proamulation of grave of 'grandmother'. Unclear how CPS is implicated, but Koran is read during ritual. Ethnography of this ritual refers to the Mantan tribe, it is reported that other Somali tribes also undertake it."
11,"tuf, healing ritual, specialists reads Koran and spits on patient to restore health"
12,"Ordination of Buddhist priest. It occurs most often on Buddha's birthday, the eighth day of the fourth lunar month. No spectators are allowed. At the ceremony, three older priests preside, one as Chairman (Hwasangsa), one on his left as First Assistant (Kalmasa), and the other on his right as the (Kyosoosa) Exhorter, this last being evidently the one giving the pastoral charge. Seven ‘Chinsa,’ or witnessing priests take part, and there are about ten Ilyu, or serving men. The two hundred and fifty vows are asked, and made and the arm-burning seals it all. The newly ordained priest assumes the ‘kasa’ robe, a sort of toga that covers all of the body except the right shoulder and arm. This toga is made of about one hundred and twenty-five tiny bits of cloth, and usually has the names of the Four Heavenly Kings or Divas on the corners. The cloth is purposely torn into these small bits and sewn together again, so as to deprive it of all commercial value, and keep up the appearance of complete poverty even when the kasa is new."
13,"Public Worship and sermon. Whenever the members assemble for a worship-service, as they enter the building, each individual bows first and goes through a ceremony which they call ‘Yum Chun Yum Sa,’ ‘Think Heaven, Think of Matter.’ They have oral preaching in the services, but never have oral prayer. This silent bowing takes the place of it. It is an adoration of something, but of what it is difficult to say. There is chanting of a hymn or two from the Palpyunsa, the leaders often lining it out a line at a time, as they used to do in the Pilgrim Fathers' time, the audience repeating the line as sung. The sermon consists of a ten or fifteen minute address upon some moral subject or an exposition of some of their sacred book. Over and over during the service, they pause and Yum Chun Yum Sa. At the close of the meeting, a number of selected members of the congregation go forward and, dipping up some of the water in the bowl with spoons that are laid beside it, they drink it. The actual worship service is characterized by quite a degree of solemnity."
14,"Private worship. This may be carried out by any member of the cult at any time, but often occurs in the evening. No special paraphernalia is essential, but, if the believer wishes, he may take cement, clay and stones and erect in the private courtyard of his home a small altar. When he worships, he places upon the altar a bowl of clean water, and then, stepping to the south side of the altar, bows on his face in the direction across it towards the North Star, meanwhile repeating the magic Formula. If he desires, he may add free petitions to the words of the Formula, but the philosophically initiated do not, for they say, ‘In Nai Chun,’ ‘Man is God,’ and so there is no need of petitions. The Formula puts one en rapport with the Universe, and no more is necessary. One believer told me that the water was used as a mirror in which the Heavens appeared and that the worshipper, as he bowed, looked upon the surface of the water, and saw ‘Chun,’ ‘The Heavens.’ After the worship is completed, the worshipper drinks the water in the bowl, calling it the ‘cup of Divine favour.’"

16,"Healing koot/ kut, possession ritual aimed at drawing spirit out of ill to eat. First, sacrificial blood is shed, of a chicken, or pig, or dog, and a generous meal of rice and other things with this meat is prepared. An awning is spread overhead covering the courtyard of the house, and thick grain-drying mats are spread over the ground. When the meal is ready, it is placed upon a small tablet and set out in the courtyard on the mats, and then the drums begin to sound, the pipes to wail and the Mootang to dance. She holds in her hands the sword or trident, or sometimes only a fan, and she postures and dances, calling out to the spirits from time to time and inviting them to join the revelry. Faster and faster she goes, whirling like a dervish, leaping high in the air. Her eyes flash wildly. Even the sound of her voice changes. People shrink away from her in fear. Sometimes, to help her, one of her assistants will take a basket and scrape upon it, making a sound like that which the boys make on the rocks along the river bank when they try to entice fresh-water crabs out from under big stones. On and on she goes, calling and calling to the spirits to come and join her, begging them to come, cajoling them with all sorts of promises, explaining the wonderful feast that has been prepared, reminding them of their friendship to her, teasing, joking, pleading. Sometimes she gets absolutely exhausted and falls down almost in a faint without getting any results. She lies still a while, and then arises and begins again, or a companion takes her place and they serve alternately, calling and calling. Sometimes the spirits are quite obdurate, and the Koot has to go on for days, usually when there is extra money to be had for the extra effort. New food has to be prepared if they go too long. The séances are mostly in the night and often last all night long. Sometimes they stop at morning time, and then go on the following night. Usually, sooner or later, a change comes, and she announces that the evil spirit has come out of the sick person and is partaking of the feast. Then she must use some device to persuade the spirit to go away after eating, and not to go back into the person who was ill. She does this sometimes by cajolery and perhaps more often with guile. Among her properties will be a small horse sometimes, made of woven straw. She will beg the spirit to mount the horse at the end of the meal, and, when he has done so, she will seize the horse, run out the door and throw it up into a tree or into a stream. The poor, simple-minded evil spirit cannot find his way back to the same house again, so the sick person gets well."
17,"These ceremonies are usually held in the Fall just after the harvest, but may be held once a quarter regularly and at other times of great calamity. The spirits supplicated are sometimes the gods of the mountains or neighborhood, sometimes come very near to Hananim alone. Seven days before the ceremony, the village has ameeting and elects from among the ‘clean’ men of the village one to be a Chief Shaman or Master of Ceremonies, Chei Kwan, one to be Prayer Reader, Chook Kwan, and several to be assistants. A bull without blemish is chosen, all of one solid colour, not spotted. For a week, the animal is carefully kept, immaculately clean and well fed. The men bathe, wear clean clothes, put bits of pine on each side of their front doors and a left-woven straw rope across it and red earth in front of it, to show any possible visitors that they are set aside and cannot do any business until after the sacrifice. They refrain from tobacco and liquor or fellowship with their families. No mourner or person defiled from touching a dead body is allowed to go near them. The night before the ceremony, a small booth is erected on an elevated point of land on the mountain-side, or, if it is Chunchei, on the plain; the bull is killed by the village butcher and the meat, and particularly the blood, is placed in the booth over night, before the gods. At cock-crow next morning, all of the men of the town assemble around the booth. The Shaman Master of Ceremonies and the Prayer Reader, clad in robes of ceremony, alone approach the booth, worshipping the spirit there. Then the Reader reads the prayer of the community, section by section, presenting petitions for good crops, for freedom from disease, for many sons, etc. After each section, the men assembled on the lower land around the booth respond with the sound, ‘A-eum, ’ equivalent to our word ‘Amen. ’ The Master of Ceremonies bows all during the reading, worshipping continuously. After the ceremony is over, the meat is divided among the villagers according to their several contributions. Part of it is taken down below the hill, cooked and eaten there in a sort of barbecue."

19,"Ki-je, a ritual service at home on commemoration day. The direct lineal descendant, the master of ritual service, sits in front of the small table and burns the incense, which indicates the beginning of the service. He stands up a little behind the table, bowing deeply twice and then sits down again. He takes a glass of wine and pours the wine three times into the small bowls of sand or rice, which symbolize the meeting of heaven and earth or the descent of the ancestor spirit to the table. Everybody bows twice to the ancestor. The ritual master dedicates the first wine glass, after rotating it three times in the smoke of the incense. The dedication of the first wine glass is the most important right of the direct lineal descendent. A helper removes the cover of the rice bowl and puts the spoon and chopsticks on an empty bowl. All participants bow deeply twice. Next, a sentence is read in a loud voice paying respectful and affectionate tribute to the memory of the deceased ancestor. The second glass of wine is dedicated by the wife of the ritual master or by the second son of the ancestor. The action of the second is just the same as the first. After the dedication of the third glass by a relative of the third category, the spoon is placed on the rice bowl. Then follows the ancestor’s mealtime. A folding screen can be set between the table and ritual performers, or they leave the room for a short while. Thereafter, the folding screen is removed or the participants return to the room. The wife brings a bowl of water which is put on the table in place of the soup. All the participants bow deeply twice and then the ritual master announces the end of the service. The participants take a little of the food from the table or a glass of wine, to share the meal with the deceased ancestor. There are some noteworthy aspects to this ritual service. A peach cannot be used as a fruit on the ritual table; the spirit is considered left-handed; and the ancestor is served with wine whether he or she drank or not during life. The most important aspect of the ritual service is the sharing of food with the ancestor"

21,Healing ritual
22,"Spring festival is called Ayy ysyaxa (“kumiss festival in honor of the ‘creators’ ”). During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests. The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them. The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn. The steward addresses a prayer to the “creators,” begging for blessings,—increase of horses and cattle, a good harvest of hay, good health for the people and animals, and an abundance of food. Then he takes the kumiss-festival ladle , and makes a libation, in the direction of the dawn, to the benevolent deities . Then, while making a libation to the ground, he addresses the local deity, “the owner of the place” ( än doidu iccitä ), asking him not to harm the inhabitants of the spot and the members of the clan. After that, the steward, with the help of the sacrificial ladle, proceeds to divine. He throws the ladle towards the sky: and if it falls with the front part upwards, it portends the granting by the deities of future abundance; and all the people utter the joyful cry Uru! Then the boys and girls give the goblets with the sacrificial kumiss, according to the directions of the steward, to the elder and honored members of the clan, both male and female. These, after placing themselves,—the men on the right and the women on the left of the altar,—drink off the kumiss from the goblets, and pass them on to the less important and the younger people"
23,"Ritual cleaning of the 'grove' involving possession by bonga (CPS) before Baha festival. In the early afternoon of the following day the priest is accompanied by the villagers in a singing procession to the sacred grove. On arrival there the same young men are again possessed and run away across the fields, being chased and brought back by the rest of the young men. The priest now assumes an attitude of great humility towards them. He receives them with a cloth tied round his neck in token of the submission of the village to the spirits. The hens are sacrificed and cooked in a hash with rice. The priest and his wife partake of one and the men of the village consume the rest of the food, after which everyone returns home except the priest."
24,"Naming ceremony, purifies community and means that religious festivals can be held. Name is chosen and announced. Midwife is paid for her services. The villagers all gather together in the courtyard, and first of all the barber—one of the villagers, a Santal—shaves the village officials, then all the men present and lastly the father of the child. The newborn child is then carried by the midwife to the barber, who cuts five locks from the child’s head: two from the front, one from each side and one from the middle of the back of the head. These locks are placed in a leaf cup pending their disposal. When the shaving has been completed the men go to the nearest bathing place and bathe themselves. On their return to the house the midwife takes all the women down to bathe, and she carries the arrow that was used for cutting the umbilical cord. Two pieces of string are attached to the arrow; one of these is used to tie up in a bundle the child’s hair, and at the bathing place the hairs are detached and floated away on the water. The second string is soaked in oil and turmeric and tied round the child’s waist; there it remains until it is worn out, when it is always replaced by another. When the women return from the bathing place the mother sips some cowdung and water that has been prepared by the midwife and rubs some of the mixture on her head. Then three leaf cups are filled with a paste made from sun-dried rice and water. The contents of one are sprinkled near the four legs of the string bed in the house, of the second on the breasts of the men, and of the third on the breasts of the women. Then a brew of nim leaves and water is brought out. This is very bitter, and the men to whom it is first presented generally make excuses to escape from having to sip it. All the women take some, out of sympathy, as they express it, with the mother, who drinks a cupful. She often continues to drink small quantities for several days, as it is supposed to aid the flow of milk. At this gathering beer is provided for everyone, and if the family can afford to do so they prepare a meal as well."
25,"Caco char, sometimes causal initiation/ purification ceremony, but necessary for Santal to marry and be cremated. The whole of the population of the village is invited for the ceremony, and each person must at the very least be given two cups of beer for each child on whose behalf the ceremony is being held. The feast for the whole village is not practicable except for a very few, and it is regarded as sufficient if the village officials are presented with a meal of rice and meat or chicken curry. If possible, the midwife who presided at the birth of the children bathes them in the courtyard by pouring water over them; and if she cannot, this is done by one of the old women present. Water is also sprinkled over the assembled guests. The jogmańjhi recites the myth of Santal origins; beginning from the account of the creation of the world and the founding of the clans, he brings the story up to date by leading to the birth of the children in the particular family with which the villagers are at that moment concerned. Then there follows a dance in the courtyard, and songs are sung in honour of the family."
26,"Dihri hunting ritual, averts misfortune during hunt. The Dihri enters the forest and being naked, pricks his whole body except the joints, with the thorn of a bush. He then draws a small circle on the ground with powdered rice and puts some adwa rice mixed with the blood which comes out from his body and makes a vermilion mark inside the circle. The Dihri then gives a little rice to all the forest bongas . Others who are following him, then enter the forest with bows and arrows."
27,"Telnahan, preliminary purification for funeral. Five days after the death, the ceremony of tel nahan (oiling and washing) is performed. The village men gather at the dead man’s house, wrap up a little grain, rice, and three pieces of country bread, collect from the house sufficient rice for a village meal and then assemble where the pot of the departed was buried. The man who mounted the pyre then disinters the pot with the ‘flowers of bone’, takes out the culm and pours the bones into the hands of the chief mourner. The latter wraps them in their original cloth and a little fire is made at the place where the pot was buried. As the flames leap up, the men say ‘The hut of the old woman is ablaze’ and the party move down to the end of the village. Here they meet the women. Some ebony sticks are tied together and stood up like a tripod. The pot is set down on the top and the man who mounted the pyre goes round it three times, strikes the pot with a fourth stick and smashes it to pieces. This dislodges whichever enemy has killed the dead one and who until now has dogged his soul. Then the chief mourner holds out the bones in his hand and the women rinse his clenched fingers with turmeric, milk and water. He then knots the bones into his waist and the men go on to a piece of water beyond the frontiers of the village. At this water the leader purifies a piece of ground, squats by the water, sets out five leaves and on each of them puts some grain and a piece of country bread. He then offers to Maran Buru, Porodhol, Pilcu Haram, Pilcu Budhi and to the dead, throwing into the water each leaf-plate in turn and addressing them ‘O Pilcu Haram, Pilcu Budhi, today we have brought the fallen one from the village. We are bringing him back to the shadow of his house. Do not let him linger outside. Do not lodge him under the eaves. Take him by the hand and guide him to his rest.’ ‘O fallen one, today we are bringing you to the shadow of your house. Do not dwell outside it. Do not linger under the eaves.’ The men then bathe and rub themselves with oil and after that, they buy some fowls or a pig with money given by the chief mourner. These must be bought outside the village boundaries and are eaten with the rice before the party returns. By consuming this feast, ‘in the presence of the bones,’ the mourners associate themselves with the dead and coax him to return. While the men are away, the women also bathe. After sundown, the men return to the village and assemble at the dead man’s house. Here the feet of the chief mourner together with those of his two companions are washed by the nearest female relatives and the ‘flowers of bone’ are consigned to a new receptacle. This is either the hollow handle of a new broom or a small but new earthen pot. The vessel of the departed is then taken inside a room and put up in the rafters beyond the reach of smoke."
28,"Jiling Dahar (going to the river Damodar with the bones), put bones and offerings in river. Deceased becomes acknowledged as an ancestor, a family bonga, but is not fully dead"
29,"Bhandan or Final Purification. Chief mourner and society are purified after death. Deceased returns as one participant becomes possessed, he is offered animal sacrifices. After this the flesh is brought out and the chief mourner again sits before the branch. He faces east holding a dismembered leg of the cow and the man then recites the traditions of the ancestors. This recital often lasts the greater part of the night and ends, ‘We have cleaned the head that was full of ashes and the mouth that oozed blood. he who was black as a crow is white as a swan.’ With this recital the chief mourner is purified. The villagers drink more rice-beer."
30,"Marriage ceremony, including speech by headman."
31,"Burial, officiated by priest"
32,"Funeral, banquet for the soul"
33,"“Buying back from the grave” ritual. If two members of a family happen to have been born in the same month of the year and one of them dies, it is believed that the other will die also within the year unless he is “bought back from the grave.” The living and the dead are chained together by the leg, and in that position the living one cries to a friend, “I pray thee in the name of God and St. John be my brother (or sister) and redeem the slave from the grave.” The friend replies that he will do so and unfastens the chain. The unchained person is then considered safe, and he and the one who “bought him back” are looked upon as brothers or sisters for the rest of their lives."
34,"Slava ceremony glorifies patron saint. Held by various social units; family, schools, army, trade guilds, villages. Priest pours wine on kolatch cake (which represents the self), prepared earlier by social unit (cake itself is a substitute for animal sacrifice) and cuts it in half. Prayers are said or sung, Holding the divided cake up the priest and the svetchar kiss it alternately three times, and after each time the cake is turned in their hands while the priest says, “Christ is in the midst of us,” and the assistant responds, “Now and for ever.”"
35,"Blessing of the Water. Hole cut in ice of river and altar constructed from ice. A service is held and the waters are blessed by the priest, who dips into it a silver cross. At the same time a number—perhaps a dozen—huge wooden bowls are filled with water, and this water is similarly blessed. From these bowls the people fill their bottles with the holy water, and this water, they say, keeps fresh for very long periods, long after other water becomes stagnant and stale. The blessing of the water is always attended by large crowds, and some of those present may be even so far carried away as to jump into the newly blessed river, clothed as they are and paying no heed to the temperature of the water"
36,"Death ritual; the first formal offerings for the dead coincide with the conclusion of their journey across the face of the earth, three or four days after death. These small death rituals often are held for the benefit not only of the most recently deceased but of all close relatives who have died within the previous few years. Each dead person is represented in the rituals by a small wooden cross, called “cross of the dead” ( kúrasi anayáwari ). These crosses are placed together inside or adjacent to the homes where the rituals take place or, if a larger ceremony is being performed, on the dance patio near the crosses and offerings for God. Necklaces bearing crucifixes or carved crosses sometimes are hung from them. The dead are said to arrive at these crosses in the company of other relatives from the afterlife, who share the food and beer with them and help carry the goods back to their homes. Participants drink and eat together, offering food and drink to deceased before procession leads deceased away from the domain of the living. This ritual is repeated 3 times for men and 4 times for women before the final death ceremony which should ideally occur 3 years after death for men and 4 or women."

39,"Peyote Ceremony to cure the sick. in the cure of some sick person, tesgüino is made, a cow sacrificed, and lots of food prepared. As in other native fiestas, the dutubúri is danced on a patio that has three crosses. Matachines may also be danced in front of a special cross. At some distance to one side, there is a special patio for the peyote dance ( híkuli nawikébo ). Two crosses are placed here, one beside the jar containing the peyote, and one for God. Peyote is not dedicated to the four directions but is merely put in front of the two crosses for a time. At this patio for peyote, there is a hole into which one must spit and throw old cigarette butts. One must remove his hat and cross himself on approaching the patio . And one must ask permission to leave it. A quarter of beef is placed here, with all vitals included. The peyotero takes this beef in the end, in payment for his services. A big fire, around which the peyote dancers move, burns all night on the patio. Participants take peyote and dance all night. In the morning the dancing ceases. Food is served, and the tesgüino is dedicated. All the people eat before the shaman eats. Now the time has come to start the curing of the sick person. This may be done in various ways. The most common is that of marking crosses on the body with a crucifix dipped in tesgüino, while the shaman rasps and sings. At the end of the ceremony, the rasping stick is scraped over the head of the sick person or over the heads of all those to be cured, three times. Curative properties are attributed to the peyote as well as to the rasping stick. The patient has been served peyote along with the others. It is thought that during the night of dancing the peyote speaks words of encouragement and sings songs to him. To complete the curing, the shaman faces the sun and makes movements above and below the notched stick with the other stick. He repeats this three times. Everyone present drinks a bit of mixture (mescal in water) as a general protective measure. Then they all wash their faces and hands."

43,"Native fiestas, Most include the idea of a ceremonial “curing.” Thus, they are performed for the curing of animals, fields, and people; for the prevention and cure of sickness; for the bringing of rain and for the dispersion of plagues; at ceremonies of birth and of death; for the curing of the church; and finally, for the curing of the first corn, beans, and other vegetables. They involve the killing of some animal and the dancing of the dutubúri on a specially prepared patio to the chanting of a shaman. All are occasions of drinking and feasting, and meat is seldom eaten at other times. Food and drink is dedicated in the four cardinal directions before it is consumed."
44,"The “curing” of fields and animals is the most important and the most complex of the native fiestas . The animals and the fields should be cured every year to avoid sickness, and especially to ward off the dreaded lightning. In Quírare, the people had become negligent in the curing of their animals, and a thunderbolt hit a corral full of animals, killing a large number of them. Thus, the next year everyone observed the ceremony. The following is a description of this fiesta as witnessed by Zingg in Quírare in April. In the late afternoon a cow was killed and the meat hung on a pole on the patio . The three crosses behind the table were draped with manta and hung with rosaries. The cures to be used were arranged in small bowls on the manta-covered table, while a pile of cedar branches and a bowl of tesgüino were placed below the table. Starting at dusk, two sawéames chanted the dutubúri and the women danced at intervals during the entire night. In the morning, food and tesgüino were served to everyone present. A blanket was folded on the ground behind the table, and a widow and her three children (who were giving the fiesta ) knelt on it. The shaman cured them by moistening their heads with a pine branch dipped in a mixture of sotoli ( seléke ) and mescal ( méke watusá ), and a mixture of ashes in water. Having cured each member of the family in this fashion (by making the sign of the cross and turning around once behind each one), the doctor made a ceremonial circuit of the patio, sprinkling the altar, and the people gathered around him. The cured family crossed themselves near the altar and toward the cardinal points. More tesgüino was then served. The men who were going to cure the fields and animals now lined up in the patio. The doctor marked crosses around the head and shoulders of each one from the front and back sides. After taking a drink of tesgüino, each man was given a bowl containing one of the cures and a pine branch for sprinkling it on. The doctor took a cross and led the procession in three ceremonial circuits of the patio, every man turning in a circle at each of the cardinal points. A violin and guitar furnished the music. The procession marched around the house, and then out to the fields and fruit trees, sprinkling the mixtures everywhere. While this was going on, the two sawéames continued chanting on the patio and several women danced the dutubúri. After the circuits of the fields had been made, the animals were driven together. The curers made three circles around them, sprinkling their mixtures. At each of the cardinal points, the sprinklers turned around and the shaman made a cross with his knife. Then all returned to the altar and made a ceremonial circuit. A fire was built among the cattle and an animal seized. A hot iron from another fire was used by the doctor to mark crosses on the animal’s head, shoulders, and hindquarters. He burned off a bit of hair which he threw to the winds. The animal was then sprinkled with the mixtures. It was not hurt by the treatment. After all the cattle and burros had been treated in this manner, cedar boughs were thrown on the fire, and the dense smoke which resulted was fanned toward the animals. (The burros were led individually through the smoke.) The family giving the fiesta again knelt on a blanket on the patio to be cured. The shaman lighted a corncob and made a circuit around the crosses, turning around before each change of position and making movements in the air with the burning cob. He cured the kneeling people with the burning cob by singeing a bit of hair on the top of their heads, and by making crosses around each one. He hung three of his bead rosaries on the kneelers and then continued marking an impressive series of circles and crosses with the burning cob. After he had taken back his rosaries, the cured ones again crossed themselves around the altar. The shaman took the blanket from the ground and raised it to the four directions. Then he took the cotton cloth from the crosses (leaving only the rosaries) and dedicated it to the four directions. All observers shouted: “Matétera ba.” A fire was now built on the dancing patio, and cedar boughs were brought to place on it, creating a thick heavy smoke again. Four women and three men held hands in a circle around the fire and danced in the choking smoke while the chanters hummed. Having circled the fire, they varied their performance several times by approaching close to it and retreating. Then the women kicked the fire to pieces and removed it from the patio . The dutubúri continued again. At the close of the curing, the women who had been dancing the dutubúri made a ceremonial circuit of the patio, crossing themselves. The men who had sprinkled the cures did likewise. All finished by saying, “Matétera ba.” . The ceremony was now over, and the customary drinking and merrymaking began."
45,"Rain fiesta. It is common for many families to join together for the rain fiesta, and it is considered more effective if several fiestas are given in different places on the same night. It is a regular fiesta with three crosses, the nawilíki, and the slaughter of a bull. Tesgüino is made from mescal ( tcawíki ); corn is not used—at least not in Guadalupe pueblo. Food is served three times. The sawéame chants, and the women dance the dutubúri all night. In the morning the yúmari is danced. The doctor walks beside the chanter, and at the first and last of the ceremony he crosses the directions with incense smoke. Three pieces of ocote are placed on the altar, and a knife is stuck in the ground next to the center cross. After the yúmari, the people line up again beside the chanter—the men to the left, the women to the right. The doctor takes the three pitch-pine sticks, lights them, and makes crosses to the four directions. He walks up to the line of people and makes a cross in front of them. He draws a long line of flame in front of the people, and repeats this three times, making a half-turn at the end of the line before returning. Then he draws three lines of flame along the back side. He returns the pitch-pine to the altar and repeats the whole performance by cutting lines with the knife. At this point in the ceremony, the sawéame gives a sermon: Here we are humbly asking God to send us rain. Here we have made a patio and placed three crosses thereon. The crosses face three times above [to east] and three times below [to west] with arms outstretched [to north and south]; and with head turned heavenward. We have killed a cow which used to eat grass here with such contentment. We have made tesgüino and dedicated it to the gods who taught us to make it so long ago. We have worked hard dancing all night long. We are not afraid, for in three days there will come the rain. We humbly stand before God asking pardon. At the end of the sermon everyone goes to the altar to cross himself, the men making the circuit around it to the right, the women following afterward, but going to the left. The sawéame now shakes his rattle to the four directions and returns it to the host, who repeats the shaking circuit after receiving it. Only the drinking remains to complete the fiesta."
46,"Three days after the birth of a child (or four days if the child is a female) the “curing” fiesta is given. A goat is killed and tesgüino is made, but the dutubúri is not necessarily danced. Ordinarily the patio is not used, but a cross is placed in the house beside the jar of tesgüino . The shaman dedicates the tesgüino and serves part of it. Then the family kneels down before the doctor, who takes incense ( molewáka ) and marks crosses in the air on the four sides of each individual. Next he takes three lighted sticks of pitch-pine (four for a female child) and makes more crosses in the air. Then he burns a bit of the hair off the top of the head of each member of the family kneeling before him. With water in his mouth, he blows a cross on the head of each person. The curing is finished and the tesgüino -drinking continues."

54,"Naming ceremony. Priest pierces childs lip. If child is the first boy, father also has his nose pierced. The ceremony of naming baby boys is very interesting. Early in the morning the family and friends, with the little one coated and ornamented with feathers of crimson and white, accompanied by a priest, take up a position on the highest ground near the village. At sunrise, the priest pierces the lower lip of the embryo warrior with a long, sharp, bone-pointed instrument made for the occasion and decorated with many-colored feathers. At the same time he pronounces “Piadudu” or the name of some bird, animal, or object whose name the child is to bear. “Piadudu,” softly repeat the family and friends, and thus “Piadudu,” humming-bird, a favorite name, becomes the name of the child."
55,"There are two major phases concerning male initiation: the ipare eregodu, “running of the youth,” and the ipare eno o badodu, “(imposition of) the penis sheaths on the youths” . This row refers to the later ceremony, imposing of penis sheaths, coincides with end of funeral. Bororo boys become adults and are given new names."
56,"When a boróro is already not eating and, his condition worsening, the bari has already pronounced death very close, the relatives anoint the entire body with urucú, decorate it with feathers and plumes, as on the days of great celebration. The patient having gone into the death agony, those present start a song in a low voice, almost recitative, and the relatives come, one by one, to the head of the one in agony and put a hand on his forehead, repeating in a low voice the words of the song: Pobo mugúia manno tadda ... After the relatives, any other person who wishes to show love, esteem, and compassion towards the beloved person who is about to die passes by, placing his hand on the forehead of the moribund. The placing of the hand on the forehead seems to indicate the act of closing the eyes of the moribund to all the things of this world, from which he is about to part forever. As soon as he dies, he is covered, because he must not be seen by the women and children. Then the cries and lamentations rise very high and are heard in the whole aldeia. The relatives mercilessly cut their bodies with a sharp shell. The cuts are so deep that the blood gushes out in profusion and runs over the cadaver. It is an impressive scene, which cannot be attended without horror and is repeated several times in the course of the funeral. Meanwhile a monotonous and slow funeral song starts, to the rhythm of the bapo , in the maloca. Bapo is an empty elliptic gourd in which they place some hard seeds. It has a wooden handle. The noise produced by the seeds is quite intense and serves to mark the beat of the songs and dances. The one who directs the singing holds two bapos; the one in the right hand is shaken with greater speed and marks the syllables of the song, the one in the left gives it the rhythm. Meanwhile the dead one is wrapped and tied to a straw mat. His personal objects of some importance, such as ornaments and bow and arrow, are placed on the mat in order to be burned at the end of the funeral rites. Many times the man breaks his own bow over the bier of the wife and of the children. At sunset the cadaver is transported to the bororo (patio), where the official funeral rites start. The chiefs of the aldeia, adorned with pariko, facing the setting sun, play the bapo, sing the roia kurireu, “great song,” the same for all the clans, except for slight modifications. Afterwards the different dynasties have their own songs follow uninterruptedly until daybreak; thus the whole night is spent in a continuous and monotonous halloo, accompanied by the muffled rhythm of the bapo . After a brief rest, in the morning, the tireless mourners continue their singing, as soon as the sun reappears, and do not stop until sunset. Early on the following day, while some young men prepare a grave from thirty to forty cms. in depth in the plaza of the aldeia, next to the baimannagueggeu , the relatives group around the dead one, and, with loud lamentations, they slash themselves anew, bent over the cadaver, spraying him with fresh blood. Then the dead one is taken to the place prepared and temporarily buried at the surface of the ground. Every day at sunset the relatives will go to sprinkle the sepulcher with abundant water, in order to hasten putrefaction and the defleshing of the bones. Meanwhile the mourning of the relatives starts. The closest ones will pull out their hair; some cut it. The hair is saved and will be used later to make a plait called ae . The hair grown while the mourning lasts is not cut in the front or in the back. They do not paint themselves with urucú and the women remove the kogu and the koddobie , which are replaced by the uaigo and okuamíe , respectively."
57,"(See cohesion column of above ritual for initial death proceedings When an Indian kills an ounce (animal) for a dead person, he does this: he takes the hide to the middle of the plaza of the aldeia and leaves it there and then he goes to seek the brother of the dead one for whose mori he killed the ounce. He holds the hand of the individual and takes him there where the hide is to be found and leaves him there. Then he takes the skin of the ounce and goes running in circles around that man with the hide and shouting, kae, kae kae; kae, kae, kae, and hands the hide to the relative of the dead one and says: emareo, emareo, emareo, a vie racuddu a manna racuddu, a tuie racuddu mori; a kudau, a kuie, a kao gagegeu adugo reno, which means: here is the ounce, the mori of your younger brother, of your older brother, or of your sister and says the proper name of the person. Afterwards this man waves the hide of the animal a little, and, if he is a Bokodori exeraeddo, he will sing like this: ui, ui, ui, iwororo meriribo bororo, iwororo iwororo Okoguebo boróro, iwororo Xibaibo bororo, Akirio bororo, iwororo iwororo poremoddu boróro, pore Kuri bororo, uibo bororo, Araruga bororo, iwororo Cado u Cadogubororo, iwororo, iwororo iwororo Coibo bororo barubo bororo. These words mean: ui! ui! ui! my patio the patio of metal: my patio my patio the patio of the golden; my patio the patio of the red araras: the patio of the down; my patio, my patio, the patio of the cataract which disappears in the ground: the patio of the big cataract; the patio of a black fish, of the arariga; my patio the patio of the Cadou Cadogubo; my patio, my patio, my patio the patio of the Coibo and the patio of the clean field."
58,"In the evening there are some songs about the hide of the ounce. On the following day they decorate the bow and the poari , while the women prepare the drinks. In the afternoon the relatives of the one who will receive the hide gather in the home of the mother or of the female relative of the departed, for whom the ounce was killed. Then one takes the bapo kurireu and sings the Bakororo ika butore over the hide, the arrows, the decorations and poari . During an interval in the singing, they go to seek the slayer of the ounce, who is at the home of the mother or relative, where all the relatives of the slayer are gathered. They take him by the hand and lead him to the house where the relatives of the departed are gathered, singing. Upon leaving the one hut and entering the other, he is greeted with a loud shout: Wo! A female relative of the slayer grabs the hide of the ounce and leaves, running toward the place where the relatives of the slayer are gathered, and there they place on the edges of the hide some feathers of the arara and other birds. If the slayer had been in mourning, at this moment they cut his hair on the forehead, paint him very heavily with urucú from head to foot, while they sing the Atugododdu . This song is followed by the Marenaruie, the same song that was rendered at the time of the death agony of the departed one for whom the ounce was killed. With this song the women who know how to dance, dance holding the hand of the slayer, who is going to receive the mori. Once the dance is finished, one takes the bow decorated with feathers, the arrows, and runs around the slayer, shouting: kae kae kae, kae kae, kae, emareu emareu emareu, avoiga reno, atugo reno, that is: here it is, here is your bow and your arrow. Then they give him the poari and, after they whistle, hang it around his neck. They put the lip ornaments on him, the feather ornaments on his head. As soon as they finish adorning him, the mother or the female relative of the departed one gives him fresh water to drink, what is left being taken away by a female relative of the slayer. The brother-in-law or the father of the slayer, holding the arrows and ornaments, take the slayer by the hand and lead him home. All the female relatives of the one for whom the ounce was killed take the drinks prepared there in the middle of the plaza. Once everything has been taken to the plaza, the mother or the female relative of the departed one for whom the ounce was killed goes to take by the hand the slayer of the ounce and thus also do the other women go to take by the hand the men, youths, and even the women who have already killed mori ounces and take them to sit down in order for the banquet to start. the slayer of the ounce goes to look for the hide, the teeth, and the claws of the ounce and places them in the middle of the patio and afterwards betakes himself to a higher chief, takes him by the hand, and leads him close to the hide and hangs the hide in front of him, together with the teeth and the claws (arranged in a semicircle, like a crown), he places them on his head. The man with the hide hanging in this way, turning to the west, says, hitting the hide with the feet: “ Ui, ui, ui, ui .” Turning to the east, he repeats the same words, and then again to the west, he continues the song, which is quite long, while the others eat. When they are finished, all shout: Wo !"
59,"The Mariddo, about fifteen days after the burial, when the bones are becoming defleshed, at twilight the songs start again up to dawn of the next day. Around noon the young men start the game of the mariddo. Mariddo , according to the legend, was an Indian of such strength that he danced for hour after hour, supporting with his arms on his head an enormous and heavy bundle of thin sticks about half a meter long. Up to today, in his memory, the Indians make a cylindrical bundle, with stalks of palm leaves, measuring about 1 1/2 m. in diameter and 0.50 in thickness. The young men, arranged in a circle, lift it with difficulty, and they try to dance in this position, keeping step with the beat of the bapo. Few manage to take any steps, and the enormous bundle falls amidst the very lively hilarity of the spectators. It is a traditional game which does not go with the seriousness and sadness of the rest of the funeral rites."
60,"At dawn, to the singing of the kiegue baregue, “birds and beasts,” the mat that contains the cadaver is disinterred and opened, and is taken to the nearby river or lagoon. Amidst that decomposition, the bones are extracted and washed by the young men, who perform the macabre office with indifference. Once the bones are washed and placed in a basket, they take them to the baimannagueggeu , where everyone is already waiting. As soon as the bones arrive, the women leave in order to go to prepare the food of the Aroe , and the men continue to sing in a low voice. The women take the prepared food up to the door, but do not go in. The men eat in silence. While they are eating, they take the skull from the basket, paint it with urucú, and hide it under feathers so the women will not see it. At this moment the women enter the boemanagueggeu and begin the song Roia mugureu , during which the uiaddo carefully decorates the skull with feathers, and the relatives decorate the koddo (basket). At a certain point in the song they slash their bodies. The song concluded, the Aroettawaraare enters, who calls the Aroe maiwo in order to give him the food of the souls; he himself eats and places some of it on the skull of the departed. Soon the song Xibae ettawaddo is sung, which is followed by the final part of the Roia mugureu, the song Roia kurireu initiating a continuous act. During these songs, behind a straw mat, in order not to be seen by the women, they paint all the bones with urucú and decorate the larger ones with feathers: cubiti and radii, femora and tibiae. Thus prepared, they enclose the bones in the basket. This basket stays in the home of the relatives two or three days, until one afternoon the mother or the closest female relative puts the basket on her back and at a slow pace, followed by all the inhabitants of the village"
61,"The bones of the deceased and the basket in which they will be placed, ready for the final burial in the water. Aldeia, takes it to the hut of the deceased, and there it is hung on a pole set in the ground for this purpose. Meanwhile a boe eimigera sings the marenaruie and later the jure dogue One morning the one who takes the part of uiaddo , together with the relatives of the dead one, takes the basket of bones, goes to a nearby river or lagoon already determined. There, where the waters are deeper, they lower the basket and fix it fast on the bottom with a stick which comes out of the water. This lagoon is the aroe iao , “dwelling of the souls.” During the time of the funeral, many Indians adorn themselves, painting themselves completely in red or fitting on the body, especially on the head, ornaments prepared previously. Many others fasten multicolored feathers directly to the body with the resin called kiddoguru : the feathers stay so secure that they become loose only after many days. For this reason, weeks after the funeral, one sees men and women with remnants of ornaments. The type of feathers used and their arrangement vary according to the clan to which they belong."
62,"Ritual associated with the spirit power ‘Flaming bones’, involving the tying of a corpse of an enemy to a tree and giving offerings. If a corpse is not obtainable, then the image of a person is carved into a breadfruit. This ritual/sorcery is thought to make enemies sick."
63,"Breadfruit ceremony, to increase fertility of breadfruit. Involves the repeated sailing and racing of toy boats on the sea"
64,"Poison oracle, benge. Poison oracle consulted on a regular basis in important collective undertakings, in all crises of life, in all serious legal disputes, in all matters strongly affecting individual welfare, divination of witchcraft, in cases of adultery, before a journey, before hunting, before marriage. One of the party acts as questioner. Benge powder is mixed with water and the operator holds a fowl between his toes by its wings and squeezes some benge down its throat, shaking its head up and down so that it cannot avoid swallowing it. Then the questioner, who sits opposite the operator, starts to address the fowl, and in about another two minutes the operator administers another dose, following it with a third if the fowl is a large one. The questioner meanwhile reiterates his question in different forms, but always speaking to the benge inside the fowl, and always ending with one of the two forms of words: “ if such is the case, poison oracle kill the fowl,” or “ if such is the case, poison oracle spare the fowl.” When the last dose has been administered, the questioner works up to an oratorical climax, orders the operator to release the fowl, and, still talking, closely observes the movements of the bird. Some fowls vomit and die in a spasm almost immediately, some die shortly afterwards, and others seem to be unaffected by the poison. If the fowl dies a wing is cut off to use as evidence"
65,"Maziga ceremony. The prince, Gangura, had consulted his poison oracle to find out whether the epidemic would cease if the maziga ceremony were held, and learning that this would be the result he sent for a well-known ghost-diviner and instructed her to commence the ceremony, which she organised with the aid of several other women ghost-diviners. In the early morning the women of several settlements collected in the house of the leading ghost-diviner and from there commenced to visit neighbouring cultivations through which they charged, rushing in all directions, shouting and singing, and swinging sticks into the air to bring them down with strokes to the earth in time to their songs. Besides sticks they carried in their hands leaves of manioc, sweet potatoes, and other food plants which they gathered from homesteads and cultivations as they passed through them. They were preceded in this romp through gardens and cultivations by a small boy beating on a leather-topped drum. Men kept out of their way partly because it was not their business to take part in a woman’s ceremony and partly because the women become excited and do not observe, indeed are not expected to observe, the usual rules of seemly conduct. The spirit-diviners and others among the women who accompany them perform a kind of belly dance which in ordinary times would be considered indecent and would not be allowed. I was told also that these ghost-diviners may make obscene gestures with their hands and utter expressions which are only permitted on rare occasions of prescribed licence. The women finally gathered together in a homestead at the edge of the settlement in which I lived and I hurried out to meet them as soon as I heard that they were there. Only women took part in the ceremony and the few men who, like myself, were onlookers, happened to live nearby and could hardly have avoided being spectators. On the whole they seemed to regard the antics of the women as a joke. These were dancing wildly in the centre of the homestead and one of them was now beating the drum. They waved leaves of food plants in their hands and beat the ground with sticks singing various songs. During the singing and dancing the leading ghost-diviner became possessed with ghosts and twitched and trembled and shook as though she had convulsions. Some of the other women beat her on the back and poked their fingers into her ears. They must have danced [23] thus for half an hour when, preceded by the leading ghost-diviner, they rushed off at the double along a path to a stream singing. On arrival at the stream head they continued to sing for a while and to beat the drum. Page: 21-23(3) Finally they cleared an open space on the floor of a shallow chasm at the head of the stream. At this point the leading ghost-diviner swooned in convulsions, and the ceremony came to a conclusion."
66,"Healing ritual in ecstatic churches. In healing services it always takes a long time to build up the necessary spiritual or suggestive atmosphere. Singing, long preaching and praying, and at some centres speaking in tongues precedes it. The congregation is made to participate in the proceedings. They may pray aloud each to his own words, the sound being like the roaring of surf. They are “welded” together into a sort of power-field by laying-on of hands by an officiating prophet who is in a trance under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Palm-branches may be given to the congregation. At another prophet's centre people queue up, sing and are sprinkled with holy water. This they carefully rub in, the women opening up their blouses so as to present their breasts to the precious liquid. Then they are given some of the holy water to drink. During this lengthy process the prophet moves around and inspires the singing and drumming of the band, until the whole congregation, gently swaying, has coalesced into one mystical body. This conveys to the devotee a feeling of security and importance. Only after these preparations does the actual direct treatment begin. This may consist of a symbolic rubbing in of holy oil on the front, the ears, the toes and the hands of the patient, thus symbolizing the healing power of Christ over the five senses and the whole of life. The prophet massages liniment and holy water on his patients during his healing services. He stares at them in a hypnotic way, takes a mouthful of water and spits it right into the face of the patient to confound the evil power of the disease. He lays on his hand, then suddenly whips it away. Towards the end of the treatment, he puts his arms around the patient, lifts him bodily from the ground, so that the spirit of disease cannot get reinforcement from the earth. He squeezes the patient energetically in order to force out the disease. Occasionally he looks at the hands of the patient, to see whether there is still evil power in him."
67,"Exorcism. After a long service (preaching, announcement, testimony of an old woman said to have been raised from the dead, ordination of ministers for his church) the prophet announced that the evil spirits would now be driven out. A group of church officers and priests busied themselves gathering particulars from about forty men, women and children all eager to confess and to have their supposed witch spirits evicted. They were all lined up in rows, facing “towards Sierra Leone”. Anyone who happened to be looking in the Sierra Leone direction was warned to keep out of the way for a while lest the fleeing spirits might possess one of them. The congregation struck a hand-clapping hymn, accompanied by a band, and in this way obviously built up the psychological pressure on the “witches”, who had already been instructed to kneel down. The prophet and one or two priests moved among them, here and there putting one hand on the head of a witch, and pointing with the other in the direction of “Sierra Leone”, commanding the witch spirit to go there. Some of the witches began to tremble under the psychic stress, and this was taken as a sign that the unclean spirits were beginning to feel uneasy in their bodies. Those spirits who persisted in resisting the prophet's influence shook their owners so severely that they fell writhing on the ground, and remained there quivering for some time. In such severe cases, the prophet or one of his assistants would sprinkle holy sand on them, particularly on their shaking limbs. By close observation, the prophet established the exact spot on limbs or head through which the witch spirit had departed. This danger point was anointed with holy oil and sacred sand to provide special protection against the counter attack. When the treatment was over, the patients lay supine like so many corpses. They were soaked by a rainstorm which had set in during the process of exorcism, and more sand was laid on to symbolize their “burial”, because they were considered as ritually “dead and buried with Christ”, so the prophet told me. Not all the witches, however, reacted so violently as this, more than half of them remained kneeling and shook only moderately or not at all. “Their witch spirits are not so bad and leave earlier” I was told. The ceremony eventually came to an end. Those “dead and buried” were “raised up to new life” by the prophet or one of the priests who pulled them to their feet. Some, however, were so far gone in their stupor that they could not be reawakened to consciousness so easily, and were carried off to the adjoining rooms."
68,"Exorcism of witch spirits before the Kune shrine. This is how Mr. Akesson describes the exorcism of witch spirits before the Kune shrine, in his manuscript “Gold Coast Fetishism Explained”: “After a victim's confessions have been heard and his sacrifice of a fowl has been accepted by the fetish, a day is fixed for the final exorcism. The linguist mixes red clay with water and brings with it an old sweeping broom. The victim sits in front of the male fetish. The linguist dips the broom into the liquid and gently strikes the top of the victim's head three times saying: ‘Yeyi wo bayie’ (we drive out your witchspirit). In the same manner, the face and the joints of the victim are struck thrice daily. After this the victim is asked to stand facing his house or town. The linguist then holds the neck and pushes him to give him a start to run away to his house without looking behind. As he runs away, the spectators hoot at him at the top of their voices until the victim has disappeared. This done, the patches of hair on his head are cut off for him by one of the fetish servants”."
69,"Apo festival is celebrated yearly; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken. The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming."
70,Bono Festival; the Yam Festival
71,"Monocot ceremony every forty-two days involving libations to ancestral stools. In the afternoon, each of the elders returns to Taa Mεnsah's palace with schnapps or pots of palmwine. The drinks are used to pour libations for each of the chiefs, after which they drink together, drums are beaten, and they dance."
72,"At the last Monokuo for the year, the manhene pours a libation on the god. On all other occasions during the year they only go to greet the god and then return to their houses."
73,"Rainmaking ritual, involving orchestra and group climbing mountain and leaving frogs to dry out. Gods take pity on frogs and send rain."
74,"The coqela ceremony is performed regularly by the Peruvian Aymara. Although representing the ritual hunting of the vicuña, it takes place after the harvest and is designed to produce large crops the following year. It is performed on hilltops. The group of performers consists of a chorus of women who do a posture dance and sing, carrying poles connected by woolen cords representing the vicuña fence (see Hunting, p. 519), an orchestra of men with special end-flutes and drums, a group of masked clowns led by a white magician ( paqo ), and a man who dances with a stuffed vicuña skin. A song describing the ritual hunting of the vicuña must be rendered letter perfect, while the masked clowns pantomine the hunt. These clowns wear fur inasks and caps and hairloom ponchos decorated with tufts of fur and carry slings and miniature bolas. They mock the bystanders and occasionally are obscene. They may not talk during the performance, but must communicate by grunts. These clowns, said by some to represent supernatural beings. The man who dances with the stuffed vicuña imitates the antics of this animal. The rite culminates when the paqo sacrifices the vicuña and produces blood, meat, and intestines by sleight-of-hand. He also makes an offering to the place spirit to bring benefits to the community during the following year. Following this, the vicuña is magically revived and the rite is terminated."
75,"A festival, called alasita , for the good-luck fertility spirit, eq'eq'o is performed everywhere in Aymara territory. Often it takes place in fixed spots where miniature stone houses are built and repaired each year. The houses are filled with miniature clay animals, utensils, implements, and articles of clothing in order that the owner may acquire all of these things during the following year. A mock market is held during which the objects are bought and sold with potsherds. They are later given to the children for toys. The fiesta is accompanied by considerable sexual license among the younger Aymara"
76,"House Dedication Rite, wilanca. Aymara hold dedicatory ceremonies, usually when the house foundations are excavated and not infrequently again when the structure is ready to be roofed"
77,"General Propitiatory Rite, mesa loqaña. A mesa may be offered in such diverse contexts as the curing of disease, the prevention of death and destruction from lightning, and the promotion of good will among relatives. It may prevent sorcery or theft, insure an abundant harvest and the fertility of livestock, or guarantee success in fishing"
78,"Animal Increase Rite, uiwataki mesa loqaña, to increase the fertility of animals. The occasions on which these ceremonies are held in the pastoral ayllus of Chucuito are variable. Rites to increase the flocks of sheep may be performed on San Juan's Day (June 24); for cattle during the fiesta of Trinidad (May); and for liamas and alpacas at the time of the fiesta of San Andrés (December). Increase rites designed to promote the fertility of ail livestock may be held on Christmas Day. Increase ceremonies are also performed in the mating season of llamas and alpacas (July), at branding (during Carnival, in February or March), and at shearing time (December). In addition, animal increase rites may be held whenever a stockbreeder feels that his flocks are, or have been, threatened. With minor variations, the above-mentioned increase ceremonies are extremely similar, irrespective of the class of animal for which they are held."
79,"Animal making', uiwa laraña, On the eve of San Juan's day (June 24) grass fires are lighted in the hills and in the corrals “to warm the animals.” Miniature animals are also modeled of quinoa dough, k'ispiña, on this day and placed in small bowls, representing corrals, formed of the same material. If you do this, you will always have many sheep"
80,"First fruit ritual: Potato harvest rite. Takes place the day before the fiesta of Espíritu in May. During the harvest season the largest and most perfect specimens of vegetables and grains are selected and set aside for the ceremony. informants were not always clear as to whether these offerings during this ritual were intended for perfect vegetables, the place spirit, or for both. The client and all present then offer a k'intu of coca each, and the magician prays that food will always be abundant. While the paqo burns the offerings in the patio of the house, buries the ashes, and marks the spot with a flat stone, everyone present dances to the music of panpipes and drums, each carrying some of the perfect vegetables in a carrying cloth on his back. It is as though the potatoes were dancing; they are making the fiesta for the potatoes. The next morning, at sunrise, an animal is sacrificed outside the doorway of the house. The blood of this sacrifice, called “blood for the food,” is collected in sea shells, and libations of it are offered to the east, the house, and to the perfect vegetables. The llama is then cut open and the spleen is inspected to divine the future of the client."
81,"Divinatory agricultural rite. This does not necessarily require the services of a magician, is performed for the growing potatoes during Carnival. The owner of a field burns coca, llama fat, and q'oa in a ring of manure, open to the east, as an offering to the place spirit. Following this a perfect potato plant is uprooted and the potatoes counted off in two's to divine the outcome of the crop. An even number signifies an abundant harvest, while an odd number presages a poor crop. The plant is then replanted and sprinkled with wine, after which the owner and his friends feast and dance"
82,"Compadre ritual. Compadre and comadre are reciprocal terms that designate, respectively, the father and mother of one's godchild, ahijado. Compadre relationships are here initiated on three principal occasions: (1) at the baptism of an infant; (2) at a child's first haircutting; and (3) at marriage. Since each of a man's children may have different padrinos, or godparents, on each of these occasions, any individual may have a considerable number of compadre. The avowed purpose of the ceremonies is to reaffirm the cordial relations that should, in cultural theory, prevail between compadres, they have this fiesta so that all will be good and nothing will be bad; so that they will have good animals and crops, and so that they will be on good terms with each other. Usually the ceremony is good for 10 years, but some people have it every year. If the ceremony is very solemn, it lasts for more years."
83,troka ritual performed in event of epidemic to cure patient and banish disease. Patient is place in bed with silver coins and food so evil can pass into them. Then patient is carefully bathed in alcohol and water. Bath water and valuables deposited in isolated place
84,"Whenever an Aymara does anything of importance in his life he always precedes it with a propitiatory offering or sacrifice called link[unknown]a. On beginning any important agricultural activity, before fishing, or hunting, or building a house, making a journey, or even making a purchase, the Aymara performs this little ritual. Usually it consists in making a libation of a few drops of alcohol to the earth, offering a leaf of coca or two, or perhaps a tiny round Bolivian sweet such as one finds in native markets everywhere. When alcohol is involved, as in the case of making a purchase, the participants to the bargain may drink some themselves from a tiny silver cup called tilinki , after having offered a libation to the spirits. In more pretentious and important sacrifices a favorite object is the aborted fetus of a llama. Coca, of course, is ubiquitous in Aymara sacrificial offerings. Another favorite substance is fat of the jaguar or utur-uncu , or other animal fat, particularly from the puma or the llama."
85,"Mass for the Apostles. Skulls of the 'apostles' are present at Mass. Officiant sets up tumbu, two tables and a box, in his home, this create a number of steps on which the skulls are placed. After mass the oldsters eat 12 sheep heads"
86,"Fishing Magic. If the fishing is poor, the Illacata calls for a ritual on some sunny day at the chaulla-ccalu (fishing-place) in the village of Uinamarca, in order to propitiate the demons of the Lake who have become angy over the neglect of men. The participants come out dressed in their best clothes in the balsas, with bundles of grass wound around the end of their punting poles. The Illacata goes ahead with the net, accompanied by a boatman and two musicians, one with a tassel-bedecked drum, and the other playing a flute wrapped in silver paper. The silver flute must hold forth mightily because it must reach as far as the graves in the fishing towns on the northernmost Peruvian shore, e.g., Viru. With the drum beating and the flute sounding, the fishermen range themselves in a line. Punting themselves with their long poles, they finally reach the open water, where they use it as a rudder. Carefully the participants avoid the fishing places of the neighboring villages. As soon as the boatman of the leading balsa throws the net into the water, the others draw off in order little by little to close in a wide circle around the leading boat. At a given signal on the flute, they put their poles down to the bottom of the Lake, lashing the water with wild blows, and ever narrowing the circle. When the balsas touch each other, every other one remains behind, then two and three, until finally they make a close circle around the leader. The fifteen or so balsas of the inner circle join their bows at the floating ends of the net, whose end stays fixed to the Illacata's balsa. The flute in the center silent, the boatmen outside beat the water again with lusty strokes. Then the net is pulled up and the haul sorted out in the balsa of the Illacata. The best products of the fishing, among them the Boga (Orestias) they put in a big metal pot full of water, the rest they throw away again. Then they all wait upon a curious old custom. All the respected elder men, according to their age and rank, approach, and each takes one of the fish, squeezes the gills together in order to open the fish's mouth. The Illacata places a coca leaf in each and sprinkles a few drops of chicha with a magic formula, so that the fish may be fruitful and multiply in order to feed the hungry people. Again the drum beats and the flute sounds far over the water."
87,"After a month of seclusion when the child is hidden from public view, the soul is expected to have found its place in the child's body. A ceremony called ki'n ha[unknown] (water ceremony) then takes place with the mother and grandmother in attendance. The three enter the sweatbath, and the mother and child are bathed in hot water and then cold. the child cries frequently, it is suspected that his soul is still not firmly lodged and has been wandering in the streets where it encounters animal spirits that frighten him. This requires a soul-calling ceremony performed in the house in which he lives."
88,"The midwife, the only person present besides the mother, performs the ritual. She puts cold water in the child's mouth and then goes to the door, saying, “Enter if you arrive, little boy [or little girl].” Then she brushes the child with pine branches dipped in springwater, and smokes with incense of pitch pine the clothing which is then put on the child. The incense “makes a path for the soul to find the body of the child.” As she does this, she says, “May your heart be one now that you are in the house.” This ceremony is always performed when the child is born outside his parents' residence is order to guide his soul to its proper locale."
89,"Three days later, a ceremony called sti[unknown] mut (eat the chicken) takes place. Only women attend this meal. In one case I observed, the child's mother, her three sisters, mother, and husband's cousin attended. Each woman brings a peso's worth of bread, some chocolate, and ten tortillas. Two hens are cooked in boiling water, and the food is eaten by the women."
90,"Baptism, called “throw the water” ( [unknown]i[unknown] ha[unknown] ) occurs as soon as possible after the new-born child's twentieth day of life. If the parents of the child live with either the mother's or the father's family, the grandparents will choose the godparent, or padrino. significant factor in the choice of compadres is maintaining good neighbor relations. Most families surround themselves with a ring of compadres which neutralizes both the fear of being the object of witchcraft and of being accused of witchcraft. Factors of wealth, prestige, and status positions--particularly that of fiscal--are also taken into consideration in choosing a compadre. On the day of baptism, the child is dressed in clothing given by his godparents. The parents and grandparents of the child go together with the godparent to the church. While the child is being baptized by the priest, he is held by his godfather if he is a boy, or by her godmother if a girl. The priest throws water and salt on the child and prays over him, baptizing him in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. After the ceremony the participants embrace the child and each other in front of the church, symbolizing the status they now occupy in respect to the child, his grandparents, and parents. Without this performance, the ritual terms of comadre, compadre, or padrino cannot be used."
91,"The church ceremony is followed by another ceremony in the house of the child's parents. As the group returning from the church enters the house, they are greeted with the pat[unknown]o[unknown]tan by the maliwanehetik who are waiting for them in the house. As they enter, each of the returning party says, “You go forward, kumpare.” They embrace all of the waiting party, an act which establishes their relationship as compadres with the entire company. When the padrinos leave, the grandparents and parents of the child go to a spot before the eaves outside the house; there the father of the child serves liquor to the padrinos and the grandparents of the child. The drink is called “the finale as the compadres leave.” The group must finish the entire liter “since it is a gift,” and if there are only one or two grandparents, they may get fairly drunk. As the compadres leave, the grandpaernts say, “Over the soil, over the mud where you take your holy godchild, your holy flower, your holy candle.” The child, referred to metaphorically as holy flower, holy candle, is identified with the most sacred symbols of the culture."
92,"Fiesta for the Patron Saint. The fiesta of the patron of each village is similar to that for any other saint but larger. There are Masses and other religious observances in the church, processions with the image of the saint along the main streets, large meals at the house of the cargoholders, and, above all, constant drinking in and out of church. From the second day on, everybody is drunk including women and young people. The sound of skyrockets is heard continuously and marks the gaiety of the people. An important part of the ceremony at the church is to clean carefully the face of the saint and to change his clothes for new or at least clean ones so that he can be happy during his fiesta. Another act is to take his image from the main altar to carry it in procession. This is important because there is danger that the patron of other villages may come to steal his power and he would then lose influence over the crops: the saint of Oxchuc helps the growth of corn, the one of Cancuc protects the cotton, and so on. To avoid this danger a substitute image is put in his place while the real one is taken out. This substitute is called gelol , the same image but smaller, which is kept next the original one."
93,"The veneration of the talking saints, a widespread cult among the Tzeltal and Tzotzil. These saints are always private property and are usually kept in a small case on the house altar. The believers go to the house of those who own a talking saint and ask him about any secret problem that might require a special knowledge to be solved. Although any saint can be asked, the most popular one is San Miguelito. In order to consult him, people have to tell his owner their problems. The owner, who supposedly is the only one who can understand his saint, talks to him behind a curtain so that no one can see him. Sometimes there is no box, so the effigy is placed on an altar and concealed by a curtain when the private dialogue takes place. (Often the owner of a talking saint succeeds in creating a cult out of the saint's box, making a special altar for him and asking the believers for frequent offerings and prayers)"

100,"After about an hour spent in this way, the company rushed out with a good deal of laughter and talking to a small mufungo tree that stood on the village garden mounds. The two girls trailed behind, covered by blankets, pushed and shoved along by the younger helpers. There were no men present and young children were warned off by excited screams. Nangoshye sat down by the mufungo tree and began pulling out leaves with her mouth. Then she made the girls crouch against the stem of the tree while the women built a sort of windscreen of branches round them. This was described as ‘hiding the girls’. Quite suddenly, Nangoshye shouted new directions. With screams of merriment, each women began to snatch at a mufungo bush for leaves. These pear-shaped leaves they folded into cones to resemble the small conical fish traps used by the Bemba. They sang a song about setting fish traps and ran round laughing as they pretended to catch each others’ fingers in the leaf traps. More shouted orders from Nangoshye and the piled-up branches were snatched away from round the girls as they cowered at the foot of the tree. The boughs were stacked on their backs and roughly tied, and they were made to crawl a few yards in this position. Then the branches were pulled off again and piled into a heap about two feet high. The girls were told to jump over it. Both scuttled across the open space like frightened rabbits to the accompaniment of screams of encouragement and threats from all around. (‘Don’t tremble!’ ‘Don’t be frightened, you silly girls.’ ‘Jump now! Jump high.’) The girls were evidently nervous to a degree, and one failed to manage the moderate jump expected and had to try again and again. When both the girls were over, there was an outburst of congratulation. Nangoshye rubbed red cam wood ( nkula ) on the faces and shoulders of all the older women present and on me as the giver of the chisungu. This red powder used to be rubbed on returning warriors and men who had passed successfully through the poison ordeal; and it is still daubed on lion-killers. Nangoshye picked up her paternal niece and carried her across her back, and the other girl was shouldered by her own father’s sister. The two old women led the procession back to the village carrying the girls shoulder high as chiefs or brides are carried as a sign of honour."
101,"The First Woodland Ceremony. The banacisungu (neophytes) were bundled in under rugs as before. Each was then hobbled by having one foot strapped with bark rope to her thigh, so she could only hop on the remaining leg, and had to be supported by an older woman. Outside the village, the girls’ legs were untied but they still had to walk naked except for a cloth around the waist. They strode in front with heads hanging in acute shame. Behind them came a swarm of gesticulating women, running, shouting and scrambling. The young girls of the village followed behind carrying drums on their heads. We stopped at a large musuku tree, about an hour’s walk away from the village. The base of the tree was quickly cleared of undergrowth with a hoe, and Nangoshye and her younger helpers began hopping round the trunk of the tree like frogs followed by the banacisungu. They sang ‘O, you wild pig, come and hoe up the rough grass.’ After about ten minutes, the group broke up and formed up again into another dance representing the guinea-fowl. The women pretended to churn up the ground with their feet and sang calling on the birds to come. ‘You guinea-fowl come here and wait!’. All the main actors then pretended to sow seeds they had brought with them in a basket—maize, ground nuts and beans. After ‘sowing’ them, they scraped the seeds up with their hands, singing. The heat was now intense. Sweat poured down Nangoshye’s face and back, but she was indefatigable. She kept urging her helpers and the banacisungu to sing louder and to dance harder. She then picked up the maize cob in her mouth and gave it to the girls to bite. The maize cob was then tied with special creepers to a branch of the tree, and Nangoshye and the two elder women dodged to get it into their mouths. Then a girl climbed up and tied the maize cob to a high bough. The banacisungu had to try to climb up, legs first. They were finally helped on to the bough by the younger helpers. Bundles of domestic emblems were now made up. These consisted of things commonly used in daily life—firewood, salt, meat, tobacco, the various seeds used in cooking, red cam wood powder, twigs of trees with magic properties and particularly of the woman’s trees. There followed an interminable series of songs. The initiation candidates hung uncomfortably from the branches of the tree, while beneath the emblems were offered, taken in the mouth and honoured by each of the women in turn, the company singing. At last, the girls were brought down from the tree and with five or six of the younger helpers they were told to lead a round dance. They were shy, tied and awkward, and the dance went lamely. It was evidently important, however, that an impression of jollity should be given for the older women sat round them screeching vehemently, ‘Rejoice, can’t you? You girls, why can’t you manage to rejoice?’ Asked why this was necessary, Nangoshye said shortly, ‘They must do it for respect.’ It was now between one and two o’clock, and we turned to go back to the village. As we went, two women dashed across the front of the procession shouting. They had armed themselves with toy bows and arrows and had tied twigs round their heads. They had leaf cups similar to those of the fish trap ceremony hung all over them. They were shouldering a long sapling on which hung a piece of ant-hill to represent a load. They had stained themselves all over with the red power. These were the sisters of the bridegrooms and they were greeted with shrieks of delighted laughter, ‘Here come the bridegrooms.’ The two women imitated the swaggering gait of young gallants, and pretended to speak in bass voices. They carried male symbols—the bow and arrow, the red cam wood powder of the successful warrior and lion-killer, and the salt, which the husband had to fetch for the household in the old days. We formed into a triumphant procession as we neared the village. Everyone carried branches or imitation bundles of firewood on their backs. Even the children who ran in front, shouting, had tiny faggots strapped on their backs. The mock bridegrooms followed and behind them came the banacisungu with the emblem bundles strapped on to their shoulders. As we got near the first houses, the two girls were made to crawl single file with some of their companions, and then they were hidden by a couple of mats carried like a screen round them. The women waved their branches to and fro and began to surge first forward and then backward—four steps forward very slowly behind the crawling girls, and then four steps backward. They sang again and again. The procession wound interminably on, forward and back, forward and back, until we reached the house of one of the girl’s mothers. Here the banacisungu were told to lie down and to put their heads first on a bunch of sorghum and then on some clusters of finger millet. These are the two most important cereal foods of the tribe. The seeds had been thrown there by the girl’s mother. The mock bridegrooms suddenly reappeared, pretending this time to be lame old men who could hardly walk. Again the same delighted screams of, ‘Here are the shibwinga ’ and the shouted badinage with the mock old men, who came this time with horns of leaves on their heads. The company started singing a song about fetching salt."
102,"Test of maturity, We crowded into the hut in which the fire had been extinguished preparatory to its ritual relighting later in the day. Two large water pots were set on the floor and into each was put one of the little darting water insects known as njelela . The dancing and the drumming started up and Nangoshye alternately jogged up and down on bent knees and tried to catch the little insects in her mouth. It seemed an almost impossible task and she failed, after many efforts, and much encouragement. Then the two girls themselves set to work, this time with unwonted animation. Both succeeded in catching an njelela and spitting it into the hands of Nangoshye to the sound of much clapping and ululation."
103,
104,"The teasing of the girls (ukubacushya) Nangoshye put a basket on her head covered with a white cloth. She knelt on the ground and danced up and down with it, finally offering it to the two banacisungu in turn. Everyone watched anxiously to see whether they would cry. One girl burst into tears at once and was greeted with roars of appreciative laughter. The other did not weep at all, and was immediately smacked by her relatives who shouted, ‘You child you! Cry a bit! Cry a little bit!’ The excitement rose as the women burst into a crooning song, ‘I make you cry. . . .’ The rest of the evening was spent in similar efforts to make the banacisungu cry. I watched seven different singing games in which the girls were pulled about and tormented. Their legs were stretched out; the backs and faces were rubbed with dust (‘to teach them to wash’). They were rolled on the ground; they were pummelled all over; they were stood against the wall and made to imitate a crying noise, which the shyer of the two completely failed to do. They were swung to and fro by fingers hooked inside their mouths. Their heads were bound with grass above the eyes so that the eye-balls stood out. The two girls were strained and taut, under a constant fire of criticism, and apparently simply concentrated on following blindly the commands shouted at them. The company sometimes gave the impression of boisterous high spirits and sometimes seemed to be acting as though they were bravely carrying out a tedious duty. If the games flagged for an instant, Nangoshye shouted, peremptorily, ‘Come on, friends. We must keep on tormenting the banacisungu ’ and the weary women started up another song. Most of the songs had some moral associated with them"
105,"Ninth day. It was a day of offering and receiving offerings—from the girls’ mothers to the banacimbusa; from the younger nacimbusa to the older in order of seniority; from the initiated women to the girls. It was a display of ceremonial obligation, of precedence, of mucinci, to use the common Bemba term. The younger helpers danced with the porridge bowls on their heads while the banacisungu were pushed in backwards, again on all fours, to the singing of the entering-in song. The porridge bowls were ceremonially uncovered and covered again with ululation. The girls’ paternal relatives seized the dishes and offered them to all present in order of seniority. The bowls were then put on the girls’ own heads and they were made to dance round with them to show their respect to the banacimbusa present. The hidden mbusa were now to be shown to the company. Nacitembo, as the oldest woman present and the representative of the father’s side of one girls’ families, danced holding the small balls of porridge filled with the domestic emblems. The two girls were stood against the wall under their own wall marks. Paternal relatives stood one on each side of them and passed the balls with the hidden emblems from side to side across them. This was to make them free to eat all the foods. It was, in other words, the removal of the girls’ food taboos. The company burst into song which goes with the representation of the washing of the husband’s hands, and the girls’ hands were washed. The paternal aunt danced out in front and kept pretending to show the hidden mbusa to the girls and fighting with Nangoshye who pretended reluctance to let them be seen. A younger nacimbusa, dancing with great vitality and charm, bent as though to pour water on the hands of every woman present in order of the assembled hierarchy. She pretended to whitewash the floor beneath each and bowed low to clap obeisance. The company were roused to excitement immediately. To my questions they whispered: ‘That is respect!’ ‘That is how the woman honours her husband. That is how he knows she has been taught. If a woman does not know how to wash her husband’s hands, he will say, “That is not a woman. She is like someone who hasn’t been danced!” ’The tension seemed to break. The ceremony was over. The porridge was divided up in a business-like way and each family took its portion. There was scrapping about the size of the bowls and a general return to normal life"
106,"Fourteenth day. The whitening magic (ukuya ku mpemba) When the mid-day meal was over the drums began to beat and the village women gathered outside the chisungu hut. We went in straggling procession down to the river and stood by the soft black mud that lined the banks. Nangoshye took a mouthful of the dirty water and sprayed it in the air. Everyone clapped and ululated. The banacisungu were then pulled forward. Their clothes were kilted round the waist and they were pushed into the muddy water and thoroughly splashed all over. Then they were washed, cleansed and covered over body and face with whitewash. The white clay was brushed on with meticulous care with a grass brush. A lump of black mud was put cross-shaped on the head of each girl and decorated with the usual pumpkin seeds and red dye. Their heads were then covered with a cloth and, still with down-cast eyes and apparent embarrassment, they led the procession back to the village. The women sang. As we came near the houses men sitting in the doorways of their huts lowered their eyes ostentatiously as we passed. We assembled at the initiation hut and began again songs and offerings of respect to the nacimbusa in order of precedence. All the relatives in the hut were touched with white clay. The girls were then led to the house of the village headmen who ‘spat the blessings of the spirits’ on them. The ukuya kumpemba seems to mark a definite stage in the ritual. It is a rite of purification from the menstrual blood and a form of beauty magic."
107,"Seventeenth day. The second woodland ceremony. Begins and ends with offering of mbusa. The officiant lay on her back beside the hole and supporting herself on her two elbows bobbed up and down to the drum beats until she got herself into position. Then she lowered her head on to the ground near the hole and lapped some of the beer with her tongue, first on the right side and then on the left. She was followed by the senior banacimbusa and finally by all the helpers in turn. Each had to make a formal obeisance to Nangoshye and to me. It was quite a difficult operation to carry out and each woman who managed to suck up a lot of beer was greeted with shouts of applause and song. The two girls themselves then had to drink from the hole with much advice and shouting. The company was by now very much amused and interested, and the rings of beer foam round everyone’s mouth were thought excruciatingly funny. The girls must then jump over a branch stuck in the ground. Everyone was now animated and interested, even though it was about one o’clock and they had had no solid meal during the day. The mulombwa bough was brittle and broke, but the company waited for the best part of an hour for a new one to be found, and they waited in the best of spirits, laughing and talking of this and that. The hoop was apparently to be set up for a trial jump to see if the girls could clear it. This they finally did. The return to the village was uproarious. Each of the banacisungu carried one of the hoops of the mupeto with the two ends lashed together to form a hoop. The log lion was balanced and carried on their shoulders. Nangoshye and the older banacimbusa brandished axes and hoes, running and shouting all the way. At the entrance to the village the girls were covered with a black cloth and the rest formed into some sort of a procession. The older women and I were daubed with red dye and castor oil. The oil melted the red powder in the sun and a single spot spread to make a great crimson splash on the side of the face, so that we must have had an uncouth and eerie appearance."
108,"Seventeenth day. The planting of the mbusa (ukushimpe mbusa) and the final jump. At about three, the older women went down to the river edge and set up the mupeto, that is to say, the crossed hoops of mwenge and mulombwa . They covered it with clay and stuck it with seeds and red dye. A small round ball of clay, about 4 inches in diameter, was stuck on top so that the whole structure was about 4 feet 5 inches high from the ground. The company assembled by the river bank for the final jump. Both girls cleared the hoop from one direction. They then had to return and make the jump from the other side. This time one of the girls failed twice. It was apparently a terrifying thing to have happened. Her mother looked really angry and distressed and beat her on the legs with a branch. She herself looked petrified with fear and had obviously lost her nerve. Everyone shouted advice, ‘You lazy girl, you!’ ‘Look in the air, don’t look at the mupeto .’ ‘You are going to bring shame on us.’ ‘Jump, you just jump.’ The girl was by this time sobbing miserably, but with a final whack on her shins from her mother, she made a Page: 98 supreme effort and cleared the jump. The relief of the crowd was tremendous. Ululation broke out. Both girls were lifted on their mothers’ backs with cries of triumph. The nacimbusa had to crawl under the hoop and the girls themselves were pushed under the hoop, first in one direction and then in the other. One of the girls’ mothers gave a bracelet to hang on the mupeto, and then the two candidates uprooted the whole structure and carried it off to the river and threw it in. The scene was very animated. There was a hot discussion as to who should carry the girls, the maternal grandmother or the paternal. When this was settled the candidates were finally carried into the village."
109,"Rites of the last night. The evening started with the entry of the mock bridegrooms once again. They came in shading their eyes and feeling along the edge of the door and the roof of the hut with their hands. They sang. The two girls were then lifted up and made to hang with their hands from rafters in the roof with their knees pulled up under their chins. They were swung to and fro so that they just cleared the ‘shelter’ with their buttocks. This would be a considerable gymnastic achievement for an ordinary English girl, but was evidently not thought difficult by Bemba girls with arm muscles developed by much grinding and pounding of food. The mock bridegrooms then repeated the performance and the rite was followed by a dance of respect to the older women by the father of one of the girls who came springing with a sort of chassis step into the hut, danced to acclamation and then disappeared as suddenly as he had come. Nangoshye then pushed her way into the dancing space and mimed a tired woman who yawned and stretched, but could find no place to sleep. A mock bridegroom ceremonially presented her with a sleeping mat and she lay down on it singing. Nangoshye then went out of the hut and returned with the big baskets filled with the pottery models that had been made with so much labour for the rite. She stood triumphant at the door with the pottery helmet known as the ‘plumed head-dress’ ( ngala ) on her head. A piece of bark-cloth was wrapped round her waist. The severe and rather domineering woman stood tense and excited at the doorway of the hut. Her great moment had come, she begins the presentation of the mbusa . The pottery models were then pulled forward and the long rite of the giving of the mbusa began. Each model has its associated song and the meanings of these songs are given in Appendix B. Each song was sung first by Nangoshye, then by some of the older women in turn, and then by each of the two girls. Each had its appropriate action to accompany the words. Some mbusa were merely offered ceremonially to different individuals present; others were handled with mimes suited to the associated song. On the night in question forty-three different mbusa were presented to the girl"
110,"The cocks of the dawn (nkoko ya ncela) .The first cock had crowed. It was the signal for the final rite of the killing of the chickens. The two birds were tied up with their heads held on the ground. The drums were beating urgently and the two girls were jogging up and down to time, sitting and rising, sitting and rising, banging the heads of the chickens each time. This is considered an important rite. ‘Why, if she can’t kill the chicken we shall know that she isn’t grown up yet. We shall call her a citongo (an uninitiated person).’ It takes a long time to kill birds this way After their heads and necks had been bruised and the fluttering ceased, the birds had to be plucked by the girls and scorched and then put to stew in water after the ordinary Bemba fashion of cooking chicken."

114,Evening of death
115,"Gravediggers travel to location of burial. They make a lot of noise, exact fines from other canoes on the river (chicken, rum). When they arrive at the gravesite they pour a libation announcing to the ancestors why they have come, they measure the grave and destroy the stick used to do so, sacrifice a chicken and prepare it using the same pot with which the corpse was washed. they rub their bodies with earth to prevent sweating into the grave"
116,Canoe divination ritual. Carried out to ask spirits/deceased questions which are ascertained by rocking a canoe
117,"The final rites of separation, patti. As drums play, three men circle the coffin, sprinkling kaolin on the ground around it. Then two branches of sangaáfu plant, whitened with kaolin on one end, are held over the coffin and slashed in two with a machete. As Apaasú slashes the branch in two, the woman hurries off with the whitened end. Then another woman does the same for Sindóbóbi’s forest spirit. The canoe bottom, now filled with the detritus of death—sweepings from the funeral house floor, the two brimming calabashes of body drippings—is carried down the river path, preceding the head-borne coffin. Suddenly Asabôsi, who had been wailing on a stool in front of the funeral house, comes charging down the path, trying to grab at the coffin. Men pull her away, and Apaasú gives her a severe tongue-lashing, commanding her to remain with the living. Against her will, she is dragged ashore. The procession continues, but before reaching the riverbank there is a final separation, from the village itself. Faánsiêti, a woman who happens to be standing close, is told to hold the whitened end of a sangaáfu branch, and once it is slashed she carries it quickly ashore. She cries as the final prayers of separation are spoken. When the coffin is loaded into a canoe, many women lament with wet eyes, “Mamá Creek is finished!” or “Sindóbóbi-éé!” A gun is fired in the air as parting salute, while about fifteen men in four canoes set out to accompany the coffin to the cemetery."

119,"Co-su-kong festival., the procession made full circle and ended at the Ui settlement, banging a gong and with a small band. As the procession marches slowly past isolated houses, the residents dash out to pai-pai the god with incense. At the end of the procession the god's image was placed inside an ancestral hall. The god is said to be touring his kingdom."

123,"Great Communal Sacrifice, ta-chiao, every twelve years since the end of WW2. This part of the ritual occurs on the third day of three. The preparations for a chiao require major alterations in both the interior and the exterior of the sanctuary. Inside, the statues of the deities normally worshipped in the temple are removed from their regular niches, situated at the noble side (opposite the entrance), and placed on the exact opposite side, with their backs turned toward the closed doors. Every family that wants its name included in the memorial must pay a certain sum, which is fixed before the chiao at a general community meeting. At a variable interval before the chiao begins, the entire village starts to observe certain restrictions: meager food, no sexual intercourse, no gambling, etc. The evening before the ceremonies begin, everyone takes a bath. Eighteen major rituals (not described separately in ethnography) are undertaken, the memorial is read at least once at each ritual. During the recitation, the head priest prostrates himself in front of the altar, and the Chiefs, behind him, follow suit. During certain rituals the head priest performs a silent meditation while the reading goes on. His meditation takes the form of a confession of sins"
124,"kong-tik, or merit-making rituals/ funeral ritual. Expensive ritual that poorer families sometimes forgo. Exact length of ritual seems dictated by how much you pay for it. Harrell says for rich families it lasts 1 day. There is not much information about this ritual other than it 'consist(s) of innumerable offerings, chants, flag-wavings and prostrations with specific purposes unknown to the descendants who perform them at the direction of the priests', but also see other notes."
125,"Shamans possession and divination of illness/madness. Burning of paper money, trance, chanting, young children made to leave, burning of incense."
126,"Shiehtuu, prophylactic exorcism rite that cleanses house and people in it. The term literally means “thanking the earth.” This rite was typically performed when the family was suffering from generalized inharmony that could not be directly related to any specific misfortunes. Involves chant to bring evil forces under power of priests, hitting of a gong so that rice moves across paper down through a hole in it into a pot. Paper money is burnt. A procession/expedition out of the village where pot is staked down. On return the 'passing through oil' rite occurs and objects are passed through columns of flame in each room, when the room is left a firecracker is thrown in. After this the process is repeated for each corner of the house and a stake with a charm is pounded into the floor at the centre of the house. Finally a 'changing of the luck' ritual occurs where paper figure representing patient is given malign forces affecting patient. It is subsequently burnt outside the village. There is a Punch and Judy show for the pleasure of the household gods in the evening. Jordan says this ritual is a scaled down version of a similar ritual that is performed to remove evil influences from the village."
127,"Triennial festival called Wangjiaw and is performed in honor of visiting divine inspectors of extraordinarily high rank. The rites involve, among other things, a procession in which local gods move through the villages of the area for three days to provide themselves with a change (1) to inspect their territory, (2) to drive out misfortune and correct injustice, and (3) to pay their respects on behalf of their village constituencies to the visiting inspectors. The core elements of this procession are palanquins containing the gods of the participating villages. Normally, each village is represented by at least one palanquin filled with small josses belonging to individual families or owned collectively."
128,"Spirit writing séance. Séances are held at regular intervals. In the case of the temple at Pearl Mountain Village the second, twelfth and twenty-second days of each lunar month are regular séance days. Sickness is most frequent problem dealt with, but practically anything can be asked. This means that various matters are often brought before the gods in one séance. Dressed in purifying blue robes the cult members appear, one recites a formula and incense is lit. Spirit money burn to purify inner sanctum. cult members chant, the medium, holding a peach branch, begins to write and assistants bang gongs. (in ceremony described, chicken is bitten by medium and blood dotted on eyes of statue to initiate, but this does not happen in very ritual) Medium writes out charms for people with problems. Drums and gong sound and god retires, firecrackers are left off outside the temple."
129,"Ritual during pai-pai community commemoration of deity. Gods carried to a temporary shelter at the temple, placed with flowers fruit and candles.

131,"The most important ritual event is the naming. Dogon have many names, and one of those is given at the end of the period immediately following birth. After thirty-five days the mother may leave the compound and eat and drink together with other people; on the fortieth day she takes the baby to the lineage elder. Presenting the baby to the oldest man of the lineage, the one who inhabits the gina (which signifies both lineage and lineage-house), she gives the old man a small gift and presents him with the child. Seated next to the altar of the lineage, the old man gives the child its gina name and performs one of the many blessings, Ama duwo, with which Dogon social life is so full. Invoking the name of Ama, the high god, he calls down on the child and its family peace, another day of life, and obedience to the elders. It is up to him what name he gives, and it often implies some criticism of his younger kinsmen: such names as ‘The wealth has not found me’, ‘Respect is no longer’ or ‘Forgotten’, say nothing about the child, but bring home to the child's parents an indication of the old man's feelings. He then presents the baby with a few coins. If the mother has some meat, she will give it to the elder. Five days later the baby is presented to the father's parents, and receives their name."
132,"Initiation is supposed to take place every three or four years. It groups together in one and the same age brotherhood, tumo , all those who have undergone it together. The members of one and the same tumo , in speaking of one another, use the expression mu tumono , my comrade, or mu ane , my friend. During the seclusion of circumcision, which lasts at least a month (six weeks of five days), the ones circumcised live in close contact with their elders of the preceding class, who watch over them and teach them the songs of circumcision. They stay apart, spending their days at the place where they were circumcised, outside the village, their nights in the house that, in each quarter, is assigned to the ones circumcised. Contrary to what takes place among many other African peoples, the re-entry of the ones circumcised into the ordinary social world does not give rise, in our day, to any particular rejoicing: the boys, clothed in new garments, are brought back to the village by their seniors, at night, after washing at the pool and rubbing themselves with sesame oil; the seniors are thanked for having looked after the ones circumcised, but they are not given any gift"
133,
134,"Sigui festival. Occurs once every 60 years. The ritual takes the form of an ambulatory dance, from a specific water-hole in each village - since it was at a water-hole that Sen Senu was found - then into and through the village. Lengthy preparations are made for this central ceremony; for three months, the ritual speakers for the village are initiated by being taught the Dogon traditions regarding the ritual language ( sigui so ), and all men prepare their outfit: long Dogon trousers, the dalewa (Y-shaped stick for sitting on), a shirt bedecked with cowries ( goû kai ), pendants in the ears, a special white bonnet ( sigui kukwo ), a horse's tail and an oblong calabash. On their faces the men simulate, with blue paint, women's facial cicatrization. In the morning of the sigui, men throng around the initiates whirling their bull roarers, the initiates are released, they run to the water hole and wash themselves for the first time in three months. Men return home and shave their heads. Later everyone lines up in order of age and slowly dances around village with initiates at the head sounding iron bells. Initiates recite sigui myth in ritual language and drink beer."
135,"Big Dama (day 1): dama ritual ensures departure of the soul of deceased. Big Dama calls for an enormous consumption of food, a large production of masks, and involves the whole neighboring region. This is a description of proceedings of first day which appear most arousing, other days of proceeding have less description attached to them (although see Dama Ritual day 2 below)Long recitations begin ritual, mourners wail and others let out ritual cry. Masked costumed figures dance to rhythm and this eventually breaks down to dance with costumed and non-costumed. When tumult reaches peak all kneel down and Initiate recites the part of the myth relating to the teaching of the secret language to the goatherd. While the whole seated assemblage forms a circle-arc open toward the base of the Ogotyé crag two masks begin to run in a circle. To the rhythm of the drums and upon a general shout, all stand up then sit down again except two drummers who begin to twirl. At that moment, bede masks carrying the crosse-seats of the deceased approach a rock situated on the northern part of the esplanade and named labadugo dumo , “stone of the masks”. Holding the crosse-seat vertical, they strike the rock with the heel of the handle. With a second shout all get up and, to the warsigiri boy rhythm ,go in single file to the tummugo locality, cemetery of the crosse-seats. All jump across fault in rock and there is a final dance. Lastly, the samana , having kept out of the way, gives himself over to a grotesque pantomime consisting of crossing the step again, which he does with many difficulties. His spear- and saber-play, his agitation when he has fallen on the ground excite general hilarity. When all the dances have been performed and the masks put down in the shelters, the men gather on the main square. In the evening, the crosse-seats having been moved and put near the mask shelters, the unconsumed men go to dance at all the houses of the dead men. During the entire night they chant the gummo wolo accompanied by drum beating."
136,Dama ritual day 2: dance on terraces with masks and beer drinking. Order of drinking very important because it recalls bonds with snake ancestor. Use of drums and secret language.
137,"Consecration of the Great Mask of Amma. Old mask and new mask placed along side each other on altar. Dog and chicken sacrificed, liver thrown onto hook on mask. Ancestor verse recited. Lizard also sacrificed."
138,"Installation of the Sau Chief. There is no singing; the kava is merely taken up to the chief. The two Ramasi, that is the Lord of Tumbou and the Lord of Nasangalau, tie a piece of bark cloth ( masi ) on Roko Sau's arm. One of the two, or else the Vakavanua or the chief of Nukunuku admonishes him and the people of Lakemba that he should be loved, that what he says should be accepted. No one may come in during the ceremony. On that day and for four days afterward no crying or beating of bark cloth is allowed. Every day they bring in feasts from all the villages. He stays in the house for those four days. After four nights he goes to bath."

141,"Feces of the infant are wrapped in tapa and kept in an excrement basket ( kato nda ) which hangs on the wall of the house where the child lives. This is done because they are a part of the child and removing them would cause the child to have diarrhea. For the first child the basket must be kept 100 days, after which the father throws it over the reef into the sea. The spot where it sinks is marked with a tabu stick. Nobody may fish there until the ceremony, called mangitchi ni ona singa , is held when the child is one year old. If the father erects a tabu stick he is obliged to give a big feast when the tabu is lifted. The feast adds to his prestige and to that of the child. If the parents cannot provide food for a big feast, they simply throw the basket into the sea without declaring a tabu. The excrement basket for a subsequent offspring need be kept only until the child shows he is gaining strength, usually two or three months. It is discarded in the sea without a tabu. This custom of kato nda which is common on Fulanga is not found on all the islands."
142,"A feast called mangitchi ni ona singa which is held when the first-born is one year old, is not held for subsequent children. If the child's parents are prominent this is a large feast, marked by an affinal exchange of property. The child is bathed in the sea for the first time on this day. The ceremony is divided into two parts, the “bathing” and the “drying” rites. The bathing rites ( mangitchi ni sili ki wai levu ) are held on the beach by the women of the mother's clan. The mother's older sister, who is in charge, collects property ( i suai ni sili ) from the mother's clan, bathes the child or chooses another woman to do so, and distributes the portion of the singa feast which is eaten by the women on the beach. The father's older sister, who has charge of the drying rites, collects property ( vaka mamatha ) from the father's clan. Parents of the child receive no share of this property which is ceremonially exchanged and divided between the relatives."
143,Funeral (may begin before biological death). Extended wailing signals for bundles of mats to be brought to make couch for dying person. These mats are wrapped around the body. After presentation of gifts the donors kiss the deceased. There is lengthy blowing of conches. Food is prepared for vistors.
144,"Circumcision. First the dirt inside the foreskin is cleaned out. The operator then takes a flat stick, like a chisel sharpened at the end and winds round it a piece of bark cloth He takes a razor and wraps all but the end of the blade with bark cloth so that it may not slip. The stick is pushed in between the foreskin and the upper surface of the glans; the foreskin is pulled forward over the stick, the glans pushed back, and an incision is made right through the foreskin; a second incision has then to be made in the interior skin as the first incision has not slit it as far back as the outer skin. After the foreskin has been allowed to bleed a little, a few drops of coconut oil are poured onto the wound. There is a feast on the same day as the operation; it is eaten before the return from the bush. Gifts are also made to the operator on that day. The newly circumcised are confined to the house for four days; they may not go out, except to satisfy nature, lest they have a relapse ( tandoka ). They do not bathe, but may splash their bodies with water. No food is forbidden. Grown men look after the circumcised; they are known as the boys' grandmothers. On the fourth day the boys go to bathe in the sea, throw away the old bandage, and clean the penis. They cut a bit from the stump of a coconut leaf, warm it over the fire, and stroke the wound to make the inflammation subside. Leaves of kalakalaisoni are again used as a lotion. Then a feast, i mburua , is prepared on the shore"
145,"First Fruits ceremony, held annually for each of the three most important fruit crops. Chief of crops: enters in crouching position and sits crosslegged in lower part of the house, facing the chief. The people making the offering enter and sit in the lower part of the house. “Ka vaka vanua, saka” (The offering of the land, Sir). Herald: “Sa vinaka me i vala mai” (You may present the offering here). Chief of crops: puts the fruit down, claps twice with hands crosswise, takes fruit, and advances on his knees.

He takes the fruit and claps three times. “Um ... ” (a sound expressing that he is pleased and likes the fruit)"
146,"Large competitive ceremonial exchanges, solevu between villages. The following is an episode from the festival which involves repeated presentations and feasts. The Komo people took the property brought for the solevu from the guest houses to the village ceremonial ground. First many manioc roots in baskets were placed in a pile. On top of the pile were placed many breadfruit and over all was spread Tongan tapa. The people seated themselves on the ceremonial ground in two semicircles facing each other, the pile of property between them. The chief of Komo knelt in front of the Komo group. The chief of Fulanga sat on a coconut-leaf mat with the chief of crops, tui naro , and the mbuli. The chief of Komo presented a whale's tooth to the mbuli Fulanga according to the usual ceremonial pattern. He gave the whale's tooth to the chief of the ceremonial ground, who then presented a bunch of ripe coconuts ( i vono ) to the chief of Komo, according to the usual pattern. This ceremony is called vatonakina . Then the Komo girls danced a vakamalolo meke. The Komo people returned to the guest houses and were given a feast, called mangitchi a vua viri by the Muanaithake people."
147,"Name giving ceremony for children of 3 years. Child is given tonsure. Simultaneously they are attired for the first time in the hip cord of cotton or plant fibers, which they may then never remove up to the end of their lives, not even while bathing or during sleep. The cord must, of course, be renewed occasionally, but this is done in all secrecy. At the time of the donning of the hip cord by little boys, the penis is tied up, with the preputium held fast under the cord by means of a loop. From now on the penis must no longer hang down, for this would be an offense against good form."
148,"Puberty rites for girls. A girl, on the other hand, at the onset of her first period, is kept isolated in a circular pen 3-4 meters in diameter, which is erected a short distance from the maloka ; her entire body is painted with urucú, a red plant pigment. Here the little one must sit motionless and receives only once a day from her mother a calabash of banana soup and a second one of water. In the evening she is brought into the communal house, so that she can lie down to sleep there, but neither parents and siblings nor other members of the tribe may speak to her. The next morning she is put back in the pen. During the second day her mother or another woman applies a pinpoint tattoo above her upper lip, which extends downward on either side of the mouth to the chin. The tattooing instrument is a pointed thorn of the pupunha palm. This is dipped into the dirty gray juice of the genipap fruit, which, after the skin is punctured, leaves a dark blue dot. This procedure is extremely painful for the little girls. Yet they bear it with passive faces, suppress their tears, and do not utter a sound. With this tattooing, all the evil, mysterious forces which are in the menstrual blood, and which might bring danger to the husband, are banished for the rest of a woman's life"
149,"Funeral, initial treatment of body. After the dead Hokotómarimá had been pushed into the wooden frame, five warriors whose bodies were painted all over with urucú carried him out of the maloka, amid loud lamentations. Two men carried the frame. The women of his kin group, in part with children on their hips or by the hand, accompanied him, amid heart-rending, shrill tones of lament and endlessly flowing tears, on this last journey to the edge of the forest. Then the five men went on alone with the deceased. They suddenly stopped after 20 minutes, set down the frame, and selected a suitable tree, in order to hang it in the crown. They chose a particularly thick limb, then lowered the lianas, where their companions tied them to the wooden frame, and pulled it up with the dead man lying in it. When the frame was hanging firmly and securely on the branch, they climbed down again. Immediately thereafter the five men started back to the maloka. On the way, however, the brother of the deceased cut into a tree. This was supposed to make the tree die. While the deceased hung in the crown of the imbauba tree, the laments of his relatives in the maloka continued, and even the children did not lag behind their parents in this respect. At night one or two men were always awake, sometimes also a woman, who, at the same time, sang, wept, and intermittently uttered shrill sounds."
150,"Secondary burial ritual. Funeral pyre constructed. Frame and rotten deceased lowered and burnt. Then the men blew the snuff into each other's noses, and after a few minutes they were in a state of intoxication, during which they danced, singing and screaming, around the flames that leaped up over the dead man. This was the appeal to the hekurá who are supposed to help the soul of the dead on its journey to the moon. The chief uttered his prayers of supplication in a loud voice, and all the other men joined in the chorus. Meanwhile the men kept blowing snuff into each other's noses, so that their ecstasy constantly increased and finally reached an unimaginable climax when the fire took possession of the skeleton. Dancing and singing continued until dawn"

154,"Rain Magic. At first only two groups of red-painted men engage in the tug of war. But if the rain simply will not abate, red-painted women also take part in it too. The 'rope' is a thick liana. This liana personifies the sucuriju which, as a strong water-animal, has the power to induce Poré to stop shaking the rain tree."
155,"Power Quest for spirit. Power is sought in lonely spots on the mountains, in mountain pools, in eddies in the rivers, in all places where spirits are known to dwell. A boy is sent into the mountains on a vigil of several days, perhaps five, at puberty, that is, when his voice changes. He seeks power that he may acquire property, be a good hunter, become rich, a chief, and be able to do all the things that are difficult. He must fast and must not touch his hands to his face, but must use a scratcher instead. He must sleep without covering and warm himself only occasionally by a little fire. He runs about constantly throughout the night, piling rocks into high piles and swimming in the mountain pools. He prays, calling loudly to the spirits, and finally gets an answer. At night he may see a spirit with blood flowing from his mouth; then he faints and when he wakes he too will have a hemorrhage."

The general plan of the performance is first a series of songs to call the spirits to work through the shaman’s person; these spirit helpers then charge other spirits with causing the sickness in a second set of songs; finally the shaman tells what he has seen and sucks out the sickness. The shaman bites the patient's body hard at some points in the ritual to draw out sickness"
158,"Sweat Lodge occurs in the summer and winter. Participants talk to the stones in the sweat lodge when sprinkling them, asking to be cured, to live long, work well, to have luck in gambling, and to get spirits. This is the same as talking to the water when swimming on a vision quest. “The stones are ‘doctor’; the water is ‘doctor.’ ” They talk to the wind, the mountains, the water. Everyone outside is quiet. Men and women go into these lodges together. Often lodge is near cold pool to jump in after lodge."
159,"Pillar of Islam: 5 daily prayers. Example: The women tied loose-hanging ends of their white head veil down over the head with the ends round their necks, so that the veil formed a hood which allowed only the face to be seen. If wearing shoes they stepped out of them, and with their bare feet trod on the hem of their long kirtle, hiding their feet. They then loosened their long, wedge-shaped sleeves that were either wound round their forearms or hanging down their backs, tied together at the ends, so that they fell to the ground over hands and fingers, which were thus also hidden by the costume. When these preparations were concluded, the woman adopted the first position of prayer and announced her intention of praising God, which constitutes the introduction to the prayer itself. She then raised her hands with the palms turned forwards within the arms of the kirtle until they were outside her ears and announced “God is great”--. She then lowered her hands and, with the right hand grasping the left wrist, recited the opening Sure of the Coran, followed by one or more passages from the holy book. She then bowed forwards from the hips with her hands on the knees, then went down on her knees to perform the double prostration of which the midday prayer comprises four sets, rak'a, ending in the kneeling position whilst reciting the declaration of faith, the ritual greetings, and turning the head first to the left and then to the right."

161,"Jam, âyini Jam, or Jamkhâna, held in a designated enclosure where holy scripture is recited, religious masters speak, and community bonds are renewed by the shaking of hands of all those present. Social equality is demonstrated by the forbidding of any hierarchical seating arrangements. The gatherings are closed to non-believers for fear of persecution, and the secrecy enshrouding the ceremony may have been the cause of the myth of communal sexual improprieties. These ceremonies occur once every 7 days."

163,"Ritual to expel illness from village. Medicine men wearing ceremonial costume, sing a wordless song, other participants shake rattles and blow bone whistles. Rattles are held threateningly. Dirt and dust is purposefully kicked and throw up in the air. Grass is cut from around the feet of the participants, this represents an attack on the illness, which is then stamped on. There is then a general disinfecting where the medicine men came to pass their feather brooms over their bodies, to blow on their heads, and to make the rattles jingle along their bodies. These rites were carried out just as scrupulously for the children as for the adults. Medicine men ingest a ground seed during ceremony: unknown effect"
164,"Tattooing of girls; unclear that this is a ritual, it is not accompanied by ceremony, although the actions are likely to be repeated and formalised. Tattoing confers eligibility for marriage. Women regard the marks left by tattooing as a protection against disease. We can distinguish at least three factors in it, all of which are associated with magical ideas: first, the scarification or bleeding itself; second, the matter (soot, ashes) rubbed into the wounds; and third, the patterns and marks incised which remain when the wounds have healed. The very scars left after such operations are regarded as a protection against evil spirits."
165,"Girls initiation. The káhuis is a dancing-staff, two or three meters in length, made of a light kind of wood or bamboo, which has a bunch of deer’s hoofs tied at the top. These rattles produce a hollow sound when the staff is struck on the ground and are supposed to possess a mysterious power to influence the spirits. The dance begins at the first new moon after the appearance of the signs of puberty, because the moon is believed to cause and have great influence upon the menstruation of women. It is performed every day until the following new moon, sometimes even still longer. Close to the ring four medicine-men were sitting at equal distances from one another, holding their rattle gourds ( pel[unknown]ite ). There were besides two more medicine-men standing up, each provided with a drum. During the dance the women moved round ceremoniously with slow, regular steps, chanting loudly and marking time with their rattle staffs which they struck on the ground. The men outside the ring also chanted, shaking their rattle gourds, whilst the men provided with drums beat them. The girl in whose honour the dance was held was standing motionless and silent at the entrance of the hut reclining against the wall and had to remain so during the whole ceremony. As long as the dance goes on the girl need not be veiled, but as soon as the conjuration is finished for the night she must have her face and her whole body well covered. During the whole period that the dance is performed she is moreover obliged to fast, avoiding fish and meat and living only on some light vegetable food."
166,"The procedure is always about the same. The medicine-man begins his treatment by spitting and blowing vigorously on the particular spot of the body where the evil is seated, and this action is from time to time repeated. This is done to[unknown] disinfect[unknown] the spot and to prepare it favourably for the extraction of the [unknown]arrow[unknown]. Beneficial purifying effects are commonly ascribed to the saliva, and a medicine-man’s saliva is particularly sacred, being imbued with the magic power which fills his whole body. Thereupon the conjuration proper begins. The [unknown]doctor[unknown] leans over the patient, closes his hand so as to form a tube, puts it on the sick spot and starts to sing, in a low muttering voice, a monotonous chant, ejaculating certain powerful words addressed to the evil demon. The chant mostly consists of refrains; it is evident that the efficacy of the conjuration is mainly ascribed to the voice itself and the breath of the curer, as well as to the very rhythm of the chant. The words or phrases uttered by the Choroti medicine-man are very stereotyped; in fact, they almost invariably seem to consist of the words: náuhea, náuhea, híame, híame . . . náuhea, náuhea, híame, híame . . . incessantly repeated, and only interrupted by the blowing, spitting, and other manipulations. These conjurations are varied with other manipulations, above all with blowing, spitting, and rubbing the bad spot. Massage regularly forms part of the treatment applied by the Chaco medicine-men, and is the only action which may really have relieving effects. — Ultimately the doctor again leans over the patient and starts to suck vigorously the bad spot. He turns away, spits and hawks up and behaves as if he were going to vomit. Thereupon he takes something from his mouth and, turning to the bystanders, shows it to them: it is the arrow, consisting of a pebble, a piece of bone, etc. which he pretends to have extracted from the patient’s body. The latter should now recover; but it may be that there are several of them in his body, or that a new arrow is sent into it which he will feel on the following night. Generally therefore the treatment must be continued for several evenings."
167,"Purification ceremony called koyadanattí. When darkness set in, a peculiar purification ceremony with fire took place. Some of the men now and then seized a brand from the fire which was made outside the house of death, and, incessantly swaying it round in all directions, they went through the village far into the forest, from time to time uttering loud shouts. After a while they again returned to the house from which they had started. This procedure was repeated several times, the men always starting from the fire outside the house of the dead man, and carrying the brands in different directions into the forest. This p. The particular ceremony with the fire brands which were carried about in the village in the evening. Object of ritual to purify the village and drive the death-demon away into the forest."
168,"Girka, initiation/curing ritual. Expected to last for around 7 days. Candidates big toes and thumbs tied together and body covered in white sheet. A feather in the candidates hair will quiver when the spirits are on their neck. This liminal phase is expected to last for six days, but up to thirteen may be required to assure that all the afflicting spirits have had a chance to indicate their attitude towards the ritual subject. During this period the cult musicians play three times a day. To help the spirit speak through the candidate’s mouth the initiation leader rubs the candidate’s teeth with a silver ring or a hen’s egg. The ritual subject begins to perspire and quiver and then stands and falls backwards to the mat in a seated position. These falls, which are allowed to occur in sets of three, are interpreted as the spirit’s greeting to the initiation assembly and symbolize the other goal of the girka ritual, the recruitment of a cult member. Medicines are administered to candidate in interludes between music, their aim is to treat primary illness but also to toughen the candidate for the rigors imposed on them by the spirits, who can provide athletic tests for candidate. There is a possession-trance ceremony where the ritual subject is displayed as a ‘cured’ person and is referred to as a horse of the gods rather than as a neophyte. Finally, the new initiate ritually washes from head to toe, gives a few special gifts to the initiation assistant, and sponsors the sacrifice of an animal prescribed for the primary spirit on his head"

178,"Third Day of the Ipad. Punhicha′an, the Banquet . (A) The Chalo′ng Rite Early in the morning, as soon as the landscape is visible ( mati′go chi lu′ta ) three men and a boy, In sacrifices that are not I′pad sacrifices, the number of men may be three, two, or one.— mostly relatives or neighbors of those who perform the Ipad,—set out from the houseground where the feast will be celebrated, and go toward a mountain declivity, where no farming is being done. The three men hold a shield ( hapi′yaw ) in the left hand, which shield they beat with a stick ( po′lag ) at the present time, instead of with a spear as formerly. The one who walks first gives a strong beat and then the two others in turn each a short beat, so that every beat corresponds more or less with a double step of the men: mumpagi′pagcha . The boy follows and carries on his back a small knapsack ( ina′mun ) or an ordinary knapsack ( ba′ngaw ). When they arrive at a suitable spot on the uncultivated mountain declivity they stop and make a small hut: a small sloping roof of long grasses ( gu′lun ), about 1 sq. meter, resting on one side against the declivity and supported on the other side by two small posts. Under this roof they cut the grass and level the ground somewhat. This hut is constructed purposely for the A′bat and Umi′chaw ghost-deities: a shelter for them to cook what they shall receive during the sacrifice. For this purpose the party puts some sticks for the deities’ firewood ( itungo′cha: their fuel), and rice straw ( u′lut ) to communicate the fire to the firewood, and plants in the ground three short sticks in the form of a triangle which must support the cooking pot of the ghost-deities ( chali-a′ncha: a facsimile of the chali-a′n, that is, the three stones of the fireplace on which the Ifugaw put their pots). When they are through with this one of the men says: Here your cooking place, Abat and Umidaw ghost-deities, / as perform the Ipad both this household, / and we return to the village. Then they return to the houseground whence they came, without beating the shields."

(B) The Lo′glog Rite: As soon as these men arrive back the priest recites the following Abu′wab tale before a coconut-cup or a wooden plate, containing water in which is dipped a bundle of rice-straw the top of which has been burned previously, and a piece of lo′glog . This lo′glog is a kind of earth containing a substance which makes it smooth; it is often used by the people to wash their face and hands, just as we use soap. After this tale the men who made the hut in the previously described Chalo′ng rite, wash their faces, using the bundle of rice-bundle straw."
180,"Third Day of the Ipad. Punhicha′an, the Banquet. (C) The Great Sacrifice of the l′pad. At about eight o’clock the houseground of the married couple gets overcrowded: the relatives, the neighbors and many others have arrived to partake of the feast. The first-class victims, the pigs, kept motionless and tied to shelves of sticks roughly lashed, lie under the projecting part of the roof of the house. The second-class victims are either tied to a post of the house or are still in their chicken baskets. Inside the house stand the jars with rice-wine. There are at least twelve jars, of various kinds and sizes; a couple of them are very big. Around the jars sit the husband and wife, some of their nearest relatives, and the priests. For this great sacrifice some six or seven or more priests have been called. The priest who has performed the rites up to this point will be the leader of the rites that now follow. (1) The Announcement Prayer in the House: Ama′h . The high-priest says the prayer: Nanga′mong-a tun mo′ma, as in the Rice Ritual. When this prayer is finished all the priests present in the house recite the announcement invocations, dividing the labor among them. (2) The Chu′law Rite in the House . The high-priest takes the crown ( chu′law or chi′li- ) of the gu′ling jar in his right hand and holds it above the jars, moving it slightly to and fro. according to the measure of the gongs and drums which some men, also present in the house, either priests or others, beat as soon as the high-priest starts with his cry and chanted invocations. (3) The Tu′ngbaw Rite in the House . One man—not a priest but one of the near relatives of either husband or wife—unfolds a big blanket and puts it on his shoulders in such a way that it envelops almost his whole body and hangs like a mantle. Then he takes a spear in his right hand and takes a position behind the high-priest who is seated. He slightly bends over the high-priest and aims the spear, blade downward, at the rice-wine jars. As soon as the priest begins his chanted invocations, the drums and gongs are beaten, and the blanket-man keeps time with the measure given by the drums and gongs, by bending his knees slightly and by moving his spear up and down slightly. The priest himself does with the crown ( chu′law ) as he did during the foregoing rite. (4) Rite of the Ta′djaw chi chala′y, Dance with the Jar . The blanket man now puts his spear somewhere and removes his blanket. He takes an earthen rice-wine jar ( chala′y ) in both his hands and dances with the jar; that is, he slightly bends his knees and moves the jar slightly up and down while the high-priest chants his invocations and while two other men beat the pa′ton. (5), (6) and (7) further invocations. (8) Goha′d hi chau′lon Rite, The Bringing-down Rite to the Place under the House . All the priests come down from the house to the houseground, taking with them the drums and gongs. Those who beat the drums and the gongs go to sit somewhere and begin to beat them vigorously. While the sounds of drums and gongs resound, the husband and the wife and some relatives who remained in the house, put the rice-wine jars, one by one, in the door-opening, and other men take them and put them in a group under the house. Only the (two) very big jars remain in the house. When this is done the husband and wife and the relatives (one or another of the relatives may remain inside) also come down. (9) Cha′wat Balto′ng hi chau′lon. Accepting Baltong under the House . When everything is ready the priests go to squat on their heels around the rice-wine jars, the husband and wife go to sit among the priests, or behind them if they can not find a place, and the high-priest stands in front of the crowned jar and sings the Balto′ng. Repetition of invocations that occured inside the house, outside of the house. Dancing of some participants. Sacrifices of animals (there is often a large number of pigs and chickens sacrificed for a marriage). A series of dances begin."
181,"Fourth Day of the I′pad. During the morning the heads of the pigs are cooked, and before the children eat them (for only children eat the heads of the pigs) a priest says a prayer"
182,"Fifth Day of the I′pad: The Ala′wit Sacrifice. During the feast a great quantity of rice has been consumed, and now they see that later on they will be very much in need of rice for their daily food. Consequently they ask the deities, and in particular the Deity of the Lagud, for whom they offer a pig in this sacrifice, to return the soul of their rice, as if it had been stolen, or to multiply miraculously the rice which is left so that the supply will last longer. The sacrifice begins as usual, inside the house, with the invocations of the Stomach-ache-deities . 1) Gi′nid Rite . In the middle of the floor of the house are placed all the empty rice-wine jars, one jar containing some rice-wine, and the ritual-box. The priests—there are usually some three or four of them—squat on their heels around these objects. The high-priest, or another priest if the high-priest does not come, takes a gu′ling jar in both his hands and begins singing the gi′nid song, in the same melody as the a′lim songs. While he is busy singing, he goes with the gu′ling jar from one empty jar to another, stopping a little at each jar, and another priest—or just a layman—keeps beating with a miniature spear ( pini′yaw ) the gu′ling jar, which is held by the high-priest. This is followed by the usual invocations."

184,"Girls, at first menstruation, are secluded in the bush in a hut with two or three companions, married women, spending the day there and returning to their fathers' homesteads at night to sleep. During this period the married women dance and sing round the girl, beating her with sticks, or alternatively instruct her in the physical and psychological aspects of married life. This “rite de passage” is terminated by a purificatory rite, in which the girl is washed in the nearest water by the elder women. Gluckman states that after the period of seclusion “the girl is finely dressed and decorated and sits downcast and tearful surrounded by women. Later in the day; escorted by her male guardian and a substitute for her mother, she emerges under a blanket, which the man removes with a hoe and the woman with an axe. The girl fetches water and is abused, then she chooses a new name. The people present dance. The girl is now ready for marriage.”"
185,"Exorcism of Macoba , said to be caused by Kaonde sorcery, is a violent form of neurasthenia sometimes leading to death. A miniature hut is built some distance from the village, and a heap of sand or earth is built there. This is the lilundu , the mountain where the mulimu wa macoba (the spirit of the macoba) is supposed to answer the call of the fetishist. The latter, clothed in a huge skirt made of sections of threaded reeds and monkeys' and wild cats' tails, holding a rattle which he shakes rhythmically, and a fly-switch, dances at first on the open space in the village. A chicken is killed, its head is hung up on the palisade of the yard, together with a long string of white beads; the fetishist sprinkles the patient with blood of this fowl or smears his hands with it and his breast. When the patient begins to dance, he is given a magic potion to drink in a calabash adorned with white beads. He is then led towards the miniature hut where the spirit dwells. On bended knees, with outstretched hands making gestures of offering and prayer, the men remain in front of this hut and chant an incantation"
186,"On the morning of the day before the ceremony, the village is early astir. Two parties are setting off for a day's expedition, by the time they return the magician is usually just about to finish his work when, from the western outskirts of the village, a shrill tilaykiki , an intermittent yell, is heard, and panting, screaming, racing one another, the men with the offering rush in, and throw down the strings of fish at the magician's feet, with the words, kam ula ula da towosi , “thy sacrificial oblation, O garden magician”. Usually they add some such words as, “make our gardens good”, or “offer it to the spirits -- may they bring prosperity to our village”. Soon after the women gather round the house of the magician, who forthwith distributes the fish so that the whole village can have a festive supper. The men are resting after a very tiring day, for they have had to run on the way back, and usually most of them have their legs bled by means of the miniature bow and arrow arrangement called gipita . Speed is an essential element in the ritual, and it is also necessary so that the fish shall not arrive in a too decayed state. In spite of this, the village reeks with putrefying fish on such ceremonial evenings, so that a white man finds it difficult to remain there. But the ancestral spirits are quite fond of the smell, as are their living descendants."
187,"Charming of the axes. the first magical net of the whole system takes place. All the men bring their axes to the magician, who lays them on a mat spread upon the bunk along the side opposite to the fireplace . To each axe a piece of dried banana leaf, about six inches by four, has been tied. The main part of the leaf lies flat against the blade while the other part is left free. After the spell has been uttered the free flap will be folded over; but first some of the magical mixture must be inserted, between the leaf and the cutting edge of the axe, and mixture and blade be left open, so that the voice of the towosi and the magical virtue which it carries can penetrate into the blade and the herbs. After the axes have been placed on the mat, the magician takes some cooked fish and puts it down on one of the three hearthstones in his house with a melodious singsong incantations, these are repetitive and long. This act as well as the exhortation recited during it is described as “the shredding of the spirits oblation”. The word “to shred” refers here to the tearing off of small bits of fish and placing them on the hearthstone. The words of this incantation are spoken in a slow, solemn, persuasive voice. It is not regarded as a yopa (spell), and it is not uttered in the usual singsong of the magical formulae. The natives conceive of it as being spoken directly to the ancestral spirits by the towosi , as from one man to another."
188,"Procession to gardens. Cutting of saplings, recitation of spells whilst pulling grass from soil and rubbing the ground. Crowd is silent until the end, then they yell and rush to their own gardens to repeat the ritual in miniature with the magicians acolytes."
189,"On days 1 and 2. All villagers should stay in the village and rest whilst magicians burn gardens. 'Though this ceremony has few trappings, it is regarded as very sacred and important, indeed indispensable. On one occasion -- it was I think some ten years before my arrival in the islands -- one of the resident magistrates, not aware of the necessity for magical burning, was tempted, in passing a cut and dried garden, to put a match to it. It was in a specially dry year, he told me, and the bush had been very tall and rank, so that the idea of a gigantic bonfire attracted him. He lit the garden, and soon the night was ablaze with high-towering flames. In a few minutes he was surrounded by a crowd of natives, half despairing, half angry, who then explained to him for the first time their magical theory of gardening, besought him never to do anything of this sort again, and prophesied that the gardens would suffer.' Malinowski"
190,"The rite of the third day, called by the strange name pelaka'ukwa (lit. “dog's excrement”), consists in the planting of a taro. Magician takes taro leaves attached to the top of the root from which the edible bulbous part has been cut off. It is by putting such a taro top into the soil that this vegetable is planted. Magicians says a spell into taro. This ritual is repeated for each plot of land."
191,The rite of the forth day. Return to places where taro planted the day before. Spell said to encourage their growth. Miniature house with fence built from twigs for the spirits
192,"Phase 1: Yawari, crying. ritualized mourning cry takes up the traditional tempo and announces a death in the village. Uterine kin of the deceased's spouse and father become the mourners. They go directly to the house where the corpse lies, enter, and proceed to mourn actively through ritualized crying. Although the cries follow a well established pattern, the real sorrow is no less diminished. Women make up the majority of mourners in the house. Only men who have direct blood ties with the deceased's spouse and father enter and participate in this form of active mourning, which is called yawari (crying). When burial is imminent, all the personal belongings of the deceased are put into the coffin with the body. Many of these articles will be removed again before interment. The climax of yawari involves the final parting as the corpse is interred. All but the remains that are worn around the neck of the principal mourner are buried. It is at this point that emotions reach a climax. As the pallbearers attempt to lower the corpse into the coffin, and then the coffin into the grave, people violently try to prevent it. The most overtly violent are close kin of the principal mourner. Hands snatch at the corpse as it is lowered into the coffin. Other people must be restrained from jumping into the grave or from preventing the coffin's progress as it is lowered into the grave. The emotion that swells the already heavy atmosphere at the grave site turns into hysteria as villagers catch their last glimpse of the corpse. Resigned sobbing follows as the falling earth resounds loudly, resonating with each heavy thud on the lid of the coffin as it lies in the grave. The yawari finishes."
193,"Phase 2: Vakakaiya. The participants, comprising the men and women of the kariga clan together with the mourning clan and anyone else who wishes to attend, gather at the house where the principal mourner has resided throughout her or his mourning (usually the torikariga 's house). The kariga clanswomen bring skirts, and the men bring material, valuables, and money to distribute to the mourning clan. The women commence the proceedings by allocating skirts for distribution to the various mourners who accepted behaviors and work associated with mourning: those who deliberately neglected their appearance, those who adorned themselves with kuwa , women who prepared the saipwala skirt, and the principal mourner who wears the mwagula . The men busy themselves with the distribution of their valuables to saigala wearers. While this is going on outside the torikariga 's house, the principal mourner remains inside, helped by other mourners of her or his dala and clan. They commence the ritual cry, reminding everyone of the loss of a relative and friend. It is the job of the deceased's clanswomen to end the “crying” and recurring mourning of the deceased by bathing the principal mourner and dressing her or him in clothes symbolizing the new status of the mourner. Once the skirts are satisfactorily distributed by kariga women outside the house they enter the house to join the principal mourner. With them they take a prepared mixture of scraped coconut and scented herbs. This they rub onto the skins of the principal mourner and her or his helpers. In this way they are ritually “bathed” and the external signs of mourning removed. Kuwa are cut off and new skirts given to the principal mourner. If the latter is a woman a new, bright-red skirt is put on and cut short: the attire of a sexually available female. If the mourner is a man, a new cloth is tied around his loins by kariga dala men, and he is given a razor with which to shave his beard. Symbolically, the mourners are cleansed of their closeness to death. They are entreated to rejoin the society of the living and to prepare themselves for the reemergence of their sexuality. This ends the actual vakakaiya . Everyone gathers outside the house to partake of the cooked food prepared by the wives of the kariga dala /clan men. Uncooked vegetables are distributed to the kariga dala /clan women by their kinsmen in payment for their work in preparing the skirts and doing the work of the preceding mortuary ceremonies."
194,"Mampapotanoana, usually performed before a child is 1 year old, the name means “to provide with tanoana ” . An infant’s tanoana was only loosely attached to him and could easily go astray. Because a child’s tanoana was uncontrolled it had to be protected by a wurake: “The name of a wurake must be hung on the child.” It was also said that a child’s tanoana had to be securely tied to him, or that the ceremony was performed to make his legs strong. The first thing the shaman did was to apply medicine to the infant’s body and massage it, supposedly to remove anything which could prevent the tanoana from entering it. She then prepared a small basket with rice, egg, sirih-pinang, sometimes cigarettes and a string of large beads. It was wrapped about with a piece of fringed bark cloth decorated with black and yellow strips. The basket was covered with bark cloth. Then she tore a strip of bark cloth from a sheet of it and a strip of cordyline from a leaf, counted them off one to five, and tied them together at one end. Next she described a circle with the basket over the child while counting from one to five, chewed a piece of medicine, laid a second piece on a piece of bark cloth, put it and the above-mentioned strips lengthwise on the child’s body and cut the strips off by its mouth, saying: “My child, just as I cut the cordyline and the bark cloth, so will your speech appear; you will call your father and mother and speak of grandfather and grandmother.” The pieces of bark cloth and cordyline were put in the basket. She then waved the basket again in a circle over the child’s head, counting up to five, and said, “My child, cry no more; if the wurake of your grandmother is poking you, let it stop poking you; or if you’re crying for your tanoana, I’m going now to get it.” Next she struck the child five times on the crown with a bunch of cordyline, shaking the leaves into the basket each time. The basket she put beside her in the pelawo during the recital of her litany. A piece of the cordyline was later planted “so that the child will flourish just like the cordyline.” In the litany which followed the shaman described her efforts to get tanoana for the child. The places where she sought it varied from tribe to tribe or region to region. This sometimes lasted all night."

196,"Incision of the penis. During the moganda it was done under a rice barn, if there was one near the temple; if not the notched log serving as steps was taken from one and placed on the ground near the temple for the boys to sit on. The boys to be incised were seized and brought together there, not without opposition on their part. Each boy in turn was seated facing east on the log, a fresh skull, the head-hunting trophy of arenga leaves, a brass tray or rice block with the tadulako facing him. The boy was then struck with the shell string and the victory cry was given. The tadulako inserted the tip of his sword under the prepuce, rubbed the blood from it while reciting a charm to prevent the loss of blood, and struck it with a coconut shell used as cover for a rice pot, a skull or a piece of bamboo. Wood could not be used for this. While this was going on the war song (dolu) was sung. The blood was washed away with water in which certain vigorous plants (mentuwu) had been placed."
197,"Funeral 1. Lamentations are stylized, body laid out and new clothes put on over old ones. Gold or beads are put into the mouth of corpse. Corpse laid in house and canopy erected over it. While the body remained in the house it was fed. The food was placed beside it and removed after an hour and given to a slave to eat. At some point or other during the proceedings a buffalo and a few pigs were killed, the former being intended to serve as a means of transportation to the underworld for its master. Songs undertaken, whilst dances come under interdiction and are not performed. The two games were alternated. They were said to be performed to distract and console the angga now that it had to leave the earth, and in them the angga was first taken on a trip to another region and then conducted to the underworld"
198,"Funeral 2: Before the coffin was removed from the house a shaman performed the mowurake mpo’onto tanoana, “shaman’s ritual to hold back the tanoana ”, over the closest relatives, supposedly to keep their souls from following the coffin. They squatted down near it and were covered by a costly old cloth ( bana ). The shaman then touched all the heads under the cloth and finally the coffin with a rare consisting of a young arenga palm leaf and small bell and a basket in which was a branch of cordyline. This she repeated seven times and then touched the corpse with it seven times from the feet to the head while reciting a litany. Coffin is then taken to a small hut outside the village where the corpse can decompose. Upon arrival the coffin was placed in the hut with the feet pointing west. The cover was then placed on the coffin, which was bound about with rattan, eight times for men and nine for women. Finally the cracks between the two parts were filled with fungus and covered with strips of bark cloth. A sleeping mat, a food basket, a cooking pot, the dead person’s sirih pouch and sword and a few other articles and food were either hung from or laid on the roof of the hut. A chicken is tied to the coffin."
199,"For the corpse of an important person a slave was designated as tandojae. He slept in the hut at night and kept a torch burning, and in the daytime he kept the flies away and wiped up the liquids from the corpse. His main duty was to prevent witches from “eating up” the body. He could talk to no one and took his food where he could find it. Nobody could object to this because “the tandojae lives as an angga , and who would have an angga in service”. The tandojae stayed with the corpse until its bones had been fetched for the second funeral, and he returned then to a changed status. In some places he changed masters or was sold, in others he was no longer treated like the other slaves, but with some distinction. In most tribes, however, he became a free man, built his own house and tilled his own fields. Nevertheless he was treated as something of an outcast and was not supposed to be well-disposed toward his fellow man"
200,"Second Burial. About eleven in the morning of the first day the bones were fetched by the bone collectors ( tonggola ), roughly sorted out and made up into packages. When they returned to the village one of the oldest female touggola treated everybody who felt the least bit sick with one of the skulls. After this the bones were brought to the feast grounds where the male tonggola slaughtered a tethered buffalo. At the mompemate the bones were then deposited on mats on the floor of the feast hut. At the motengke they were first made up like dolls, provided with masks ( pemia, ) from Mori mia, “human being”, or kalio, “image of a face”) and placed on a catafalque. There was one type of mask for females and one for males. After the ceremonies they were stored in the rice barn along with other decorations from the feast and were used again for succeeding funerals. The catafalque consisted of a solid bench surrounded by pieces of costly cotton ( bana ) and decorated with cordyline, sugar cane, swords and shields. The litany described how the dead were waked, dressed themselves and were conducted through the underworld to the pinang tree which they climbed to reach the earth, where they came out in Mori (to the east of the Toradja), and finally were led to the temple or feast hut. There they were welcomed by their relatives and entertained by them and the rest of the participants with singing and dancing. In the songs the dead were brought up to date on the current affairs of the living. During this part of the ceremonies, which lasted a whole night from dusk to dawn, the men were permitted to ask a girl to be their partner. The man rested his elbow on the girl’s shoulder and was allowed to touch her face and breast, in exchange for which he gave her a sarong or some other present. When she had had enough of it she would hang a white cotton or bark cloth sarong over his shoulder and the relationship would be ended. While they were together they were considered to be man and wife."
201,"moandu sala , ""to float (the) evil away”. Allows marriage that is usually prohibited to occur. The couple concerned went to the river with a white fowl and a pig. They either sat on the rope attached to the latter or on the stick used to carry it or both animals were carried around them seven times. A hole was dug beside them. An elder then invoked the gods: O you above and you below, here is our present of reconciliation (polanga) , which we give in place of X and Y (the names of the guilty persons), who have been stupid, so that the guilt will be taken from them and floated down the river and rain and drought will regularly alternate. May the water take away their guilt and dump it into the abyss, through the yellow places in the river, through the white and through the dark, till it comes to the sea and the latter propel it and bring it to where it falls down below.” Then clothing of the man and the woman were placed in the hole and the fowl and pig were killed, while the couple placed their hands on them, by a brother or cousin of the man, who first said: “Here are two people who have committed incest; actually they should be killed themselves, but we now kill a pig and a fowl in their place.” The blood was dripped onto the clothes in the hole, which was then closed up. Part of the blood was mixed with water and sprinkled on the couple and their fellow villagers. Part of the pig was eaten (but not by the guilty couple) and the rest was thrown into the river. Either before or after this meal the couple walked a way into the river, let an old jacket float away and called, “My guilt has been removed”. this ritual format is also used to float the sins of the community down the river before the clearing of the forest for new feilds and for planting the rice."
202,"morambu langi, “to becloud the sky”. More complicated version of above ritual. the man had to provide a male buffalo and the woman a brown striped pig or one with a white belly ( wawu bala ). In addition one or more white fowl were required. On the way to the river the guilty man often had mud thrown at him and buffalo dung stuffed in his mouth. An altar was erected there and a hole or two intersecting ditches. The pig was placed near it or them and surrounded by red cotton, while the couple squatted there too and were covered with white cotton. The leader invoked the gods with his right foot on the pig and a white fowl under his arm, asking for them to make exception for the incestuous marriage and for crops and animals to be fortuitous. Fowl and pig are killed and their blood dripped in hole, followed by sacrifice of buffalo. After the meal which followed a miniature prahu, in which were placed various things, including clothes of the couple, an egg and (or) a coin touched by all the villagers, parts of the animals sacrificed and various edible plants, was floated down the river. When this had been done every one passed under a miniature gate set up on the bank and were treated with medicine."
203,"Mowase, “to apply blood to”, was an elaborate ceremony performed to cure a patient whom other means had failed to help or one who had become suddenly ill without apparent cause or one whose ailment was thought to be due to the wrath of Pue mpalaburu. An elaborate altar was set up and a pig was placed at its foot. An elder then addressed the gods in the usual manner, his right foot on the pig and a white fowl in his arms. The animals were slaughtered, their blood was caught and mixed with the finely chopped leaves of various vigorous plants and water. The shamans then rubbed the bodies of the patients with it. Part of the animals was hung up as offering, part went to the shamans as payment and the rest was consumed at the meal which followed."
204,"the mombakati , “to mark something”. Before dawn of a particularly favorable day of the month each work group assembled in the forest on the land allotted to its leader. A spot was chosen where a pokae tree (Ficus erecta) grew; if there was none, one was transplanted from elsewhere (it made no difference if it died later on). A tree was preferred which leaned toward the east and which had a parasitic plant growing on it. The pokae was called “the tree of human life”. It had grown from the body of some one who had had special power over rain and sunshine: “Therefore this tree became our god (lamoa) in the fields”. According to a story recorded in the first edition the ancestors instructed their descendants to plant the tree so that they would have a ladder by which to enter the fields. Various signs which foretold the fate of the coming activities were observed and then a couple of square meters of the ground around the pokae were thoroughly cleared. Then sirih-pinang, beads and tobacco were prepared for the owner of the ground (tumpu ntana) , tree spirits (bela) , ancestors (sumanga uiau iu’a) and to make the ground cool. They were buried and sticks of pokae wood were planted around them. The leader then invoked first the gods above and below, who were asked for their help in the coming season. Next he addressed the dead (sumangali anu mate): “Perhaps you have come to watch us, or perhaps you are laughing at us because we don’t follow the rules properly, for we are dumb, blind and deaf; do not come and speak to us. If you hadn’t insisted on leaving us you would still be with us and it would be you who buried the sirih-pinang in the ground.You have served the gods of the fields whom we now invoke, for we have taken your place. Even though we do something of which you don’t approve, do not speak to us about it, so that we won’t get feverish and sick, so that we will stay healthy as long as we till this field”. Finally he addressed the pokae itself: “You, pokae , whose second name is kadju ndatunde (“tree which is persuaded to help”), we have chosen you above all other trees. Whenever we come to do anything in the field we will give you food, you who watch over the field. If we do anything wrong you must put it right, if we sin with our mouths, with our hands or with our bodies you must let us know of it”. The leader then cut some of the undergrowth around the cleared spot with a certain number of strokes and chopped down the pokae sticks with a single blow. A day or two later the ground around the pokae was inspected for omens. The spot where the mombakati was performed was called pongkaresi , “sweeper, scraper”. Once the mombakati had been performed in the leader’s field each of the households installed a pongkaresi in their own."
205,"They day before the rice was planted a big feast, molanggo , was given at which a large number of gods and spirits were invoked. It was sometimes said that it served to “bring the anitu and the lamoa nawu together”. These were, first of all, Ndara, the earth goddess, who was asked to drive away everything bad so that the crop would succeed, and Pue mpalaburu, who was to protect the people from evil and give them the grain of the rice. Then Ndo i ronda eo and Ndo i ntjungata dila (apparently an agricultural goddess - she was not mentioned elsewhere) were also asked for the grain of the rice. Next the leader drenched the earth with the blood of a fowl and split a stalk (mantjela panga) to remove the sins of the people. Then he invoked the tree stumps and, at the edge of the field, the bela . Just outside the field, by the path which led to it, the rampo (gluttonous spirits) were asked to stay away. Even the improper words which might have been spoken by the people and which could have an ill effect on the crops were disowned. Finally a couple of square meters of ground were set apart and planted for the angga . The seeds of the pumpkins, cucumbers, rice and maize which were planted there were bitten so that they wouldn’t come up, otherwise the crops of the living would fail. The angga were then addressed: “Come you dead to plant your rice, for you will do it. tonight; tomorrow we do it. Make our field shrink so that we will soon be finished with the planting. Do not come to look at our field and do not visit us in the form of mice and pigs”. Then the leader and a few companions sat down to a meal with the angga. Before dusk that afternoon the youths were encouraged to play at striking each other’s calves (mowinti) , a rather painful endurance contest. This was done on other festive occasions as well, but was obligatory on this one, as it was thought to have a beneficial effect on the crops. During the night, while the young people performed round dances, a shaman recited a litany in the field hut in which she asked the wurake for the soul of the rice (lanoana mpae) . She brought back a couple of rice grains, which were planted by the pongkaresi , where the rice soul for the whole field was thought to stay till the harvest."
206,"Harvest. At dawn a ceremonial procession was held to the field. When she arrived at the hut there the leader first invoked the dead, whom she asked not to mislead the harvesters, but to guide them in their work, and then she and her helpers made packages of harvest “medicines”. Next she prepared what was called pesua , “place of entering”. The field was conceived of as a human body, and the leader chose a spot for the pesua on its chest, thus in the upper part of the field, but on the left side of it. There she sought out a rice plant that suited her (various criteria were followed), bound it together with three others and treated them with various medicines. A small hut (kandepe pesua) was erected over them (III, 104ff.; 1912: II, 279). Close by the pesua she ceremonially treated and cut another plant, the tadulako mpae , “leader of the rice”, and then proceeded to harvest alone for a certain number of days (III, 108ff.)."
207,"Molinga. Towards the end of the harvest, when some of the families had finished with their fields and if the yield had been good, the youths assembled before one of the houses in the village and sang verses (molinga) to the girls, who had come together there. The verses mostly concerned the events of married life (examples are given in 1912: III, 542f.). This was repeated a few times, but not on consecutive nights. The final night the youths and girls assembled in a house, where they sang the verses while seated opposite each other. They were assumed to be married, and the verses were about a trip made to a distant place. In some tribes this was followed by the description of a trip to the upperworld on the rainbow in order to inform the gods that the harvest was nearly over"
208,"The molinga was ended with the mopasangke . Two poles about three meters high were erected three to four meters apart. They were called ambarale (which probably referred originally to the two miniature houses which used to be set up instead of the poles), toko mpajope , “pole of descent”, or toko sora , “decorated pole”. Cross bars were attached to the tops of the poles and presents hung from them, those for the women on one pole and those for the men on the other. In addition the ritual clothes (ajapa lamoa) of the shaman and harvest leader were hung on the one and those worn by the men at the head-hunting feasts on the other. The youths and girls who had taken part in the molinga sat around the poles and the rest of the villagers ranged themselves around them in a wide circle. Verses were sung back and forth between the men and the women, first about the poles and then about the separation of the youthful couples. Before the poles were dismantled and the presents exchanged, a man walked around the men’s pole seven times, squatting down after each time around to sing verses. In these he asked that no misfortune befall him for taking down the pole and boasted of his heroic deeds as a head-hunter. A woman then did the same around the women’s pole, bragging of her trips to the upperworld in the moon"
209,"Harvest feast. This is held at the field hut, where rice from all the fields (one bundle from each) was brought. Colored rice was placed on an alter outside it, with water, palm wine and a pig at its foot. Then an elder stood by it with a white fowl in his arm and his right foot on the pig, and invoked a long series of gods, whom he asked to give even more rice the following year. After this the pig and fowl were carried around the hut and altar seven times followed by all the harvest leaders. This was called magolili tonggola , “to walk around the tonggola (the hut in which the coffins were placed)”. The fowl was killed above the rice and its feathers were stuck in the ground around it. The blood of the pig was allowed to flow into a hole in the ground. Those present dipped their fingers in it and marked their cheeks with it. While all this was going on the harvest was celebrated, if it had been particularly successful, by the singing of the tawanggu . They resembled the bolingoni sung during the harvesting, but were more serious in character. The youths made trumpets from rice straw and engaged in mock battles with the rice stubble as weapons."
210,"Potlach after a chief has died (potlach does occur at other times), wealth from his people is redistributed so that the deceased may benefit in the spirit world. There is a feast where all food is eaten for the dead—not only for the dead chief, but for all ancestors of the host moiety. Two nakani loudly announce the names of the dead who are to receive the food, so that the spirits of the other world may hear. The guests themselves represent their own illustrious ancestors who have come to “show respect” and to comfort their grieving hosts. When the meal is over, the host chief, wearing the most honored crest hat of his sib, initiates eight potlatch songs and dances, and begins in this way the collection of wealth which is to be distributed to the guests: furs, tanned skins, a valuable old “copper,” blankets, bolts of calico, and money. After making his own contribution, the chief calls on his people one by one, men and women, naming the highest ranking individuals first. Before these persons add their goods or money, the high ranking ones make long speeches referring to their dead ancestors, and they too wear their most honored hats and other paraphernalia and start valuable potlatch songs and dances in which they are joined by their sibmates. There is dancing and singing by groups who have recieved his wealth. Each group attempts to outdo the others in thier 'thank yous'. There is a joking air to the celebrations by this point."
211,"Cremation. The male members of the family [lineage] of the dead man were grouped a short distance from the pyre. They were dressed in old robes tied about the waist with cedar-bark rope, their faces blackened and hair disheveled. At their head was an old man of high rank who beat time with a long baton in his hand, as he led the slow death chant. This was taken up in a shrill key by some thirty women of the widow’s clan, who stood in a semicircle on the opposite side of the pyre. They were dressed in blue blankets with wide red borders and rows of pearl buttons. Their faces were blackened, heads bound with black handkerchiefs. ”]. To the right of the men of the lineage, seated on the ground, dressed in old clothes, with faces blackened and hair cut short, were the widow and female members of the lineage who kept up a continuous wailing. Two men, brothers of the widow, tended the fire with long poles, and at intervals valuable pieces of property, such as guns, robes, and clothing, were cast into the flames. After the fire had burned down, the charred bones and ashes were gathered up and placed in a handsomely carved, oblong chest which was corded and deposited in the family [lineage] gravehouse behind the dwelling. According to old custom the family used to cleanse themselves by going into salt water, but in this case the men and women repaired to separate houses to bathe, in preparation for the invitation feast which always followed cremation. At the cremation of a chief, sometimes one or more slaves were killed to attend to his wants in the next world."
212,"Girls puberty rites. At the conclusion of her confinement, if the family were of high caste, her father gave a feast at which time she was bathed and dressed in new robes, and the confinement hat [puberty hood] was exchanged for one smaller, which was hung with a fringe of fur that partly concealed her face. She was seated in the place of honor opposite the doorway. Her lower lip was pinched until it was numb and then was pierced by her father’s sister or a female member of his family [lineage] with a sharpened bear claw or bone awl, and a small bone plug was introduced to keep the hole open. In honor of this occasion and as a demonstration of the position and wealth of the family, a slave might be freed. Confinement begins at the first signs of puberty, for a period of four months. The girl fasted for the first four days, drinking water only in the evening. She ate on the fifth day, and then fasted for four more days. During this period her fingers were bound; she was not allowed to wash, comb her hair or do any work; only her mother or her attendant was allowed to see her. After this fasting period was over, however, she was visited by her female relatives and playmates. Throughout her confinement, her food was restricted to dried fish and meat, oil, and berries; and no fresh sea food was permitted. She drank water slowly through a bone tube, made of the leg bone of a swan or goose. Around her neck she wore suspended a stone charm with which she scratched her head or body; fingernails were never used. In confinement the girls is instructed in those procedures and manners of her future life which she had not already learned through observation. She never went out in the daylight, but at night."
213,"The guests were seated on either side of the house, the host with his brothers and friends [clansmen or lineage-mates] in the front space, while the groom, in ceremonial dress, occupied the place of honor opposite the doorway, seated on a new mat. The bride was hidden in a back corner of the house. Speeches were made by the head men of both families. Then the accumulated property was distributed to the host’s [bride’s] family and some to the groom’s family. Then the bride was called. Taking her hand, her father led her to the groom and seated her at his side; or, while the family [clan] song was chanted, she might come forth and approach the groom, singing and dancing. She was covered from shoulders to feet in a ceremonial blanket, wore moccasins on her feet, while a woven spruce root hat covered much of her face. More property was then distributed, of which the host gave some to the groom as a token of good will, thus ending the ceremony."
214,"Dedication of the house. When the house was ready, the owner and his family [lineage] would enter, the men standing near the door in ordinary clothes, the women dressed in dance blankets [button blankets] and ornaments were ranged on each side near the walls. Then the drum was beaten four times four, and they swayed the body with it. [Paul specified that the men swayed.] This dance is called Ah-ketch, “putting it together with wings” [[unknown]yaduwakí[unknown]c, “they had a housewarming ceremony,” from kít[unknown]c, “wings”]. [Paul: “The four corners of the house are put together with their wings. It takes less than an hour to go through this performance.”] This procedure may have originated at a very early period when the walls of the house were constructed by lashing planks together and each side was raised in one section. This is the only ceremony in which no guests were present."
215,"In the evening, the clans of the opposite phratry assembled for the Smoking Feast, Sa-kesk-ko-eek. The host, with one of his family who acts as a leader, and other men of his family [clan, lineage?], all poorly dressed, with dance staffs in hand, stood in front, just to one side of the doorway; the women of the family, wearing ceremonial blankets [button blankets] and ornaments were ranged along the walls on either side. The guests were seated in the body of the house around the fire, those most important opposite the door. The host welcomed his guests and related his family history. He was answered by the guest chiefs [heads of houses]. The Na-ka-nee [na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni], “[clan] brothers-in-law,” separated the tobacco leaves, pieces of which were put into the fire as the names of the dead were called; they were believed to be present in spirit and to receive the gift as it was consumed by the flame with the same satisfaction as felt by those who were present in the flesh. The host might furnish pipes to the most honored guests, but the people generally brought their own. The Na-ka-nee [na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni] filled them and lit the pipes for the guests. Then the leader started the family songs [of the host clan], and called on members of the family to start other songs. The women of the family sang and swayed their bodies in unison with the song. At this feast there might be a small distribution of property. The leader calls on each man to start up a song. After each song, blankets and calico are distributed. Each woman is called upon to start a song. At this feast they take new names, any name of their dead relatives."
216,"The next day, about ten o’clock in the morning, the drums were beaten and the guests assembled in ordinary dress and filled the body of the house. As before, the host, with the men of his family [clan], stood at the left of the door, poorly dressed and with dance staff in hand. The women of the family were dressed [in ceremonial clothing, as before] and were ranged along the side walls. This meeting was called Ut-keh-yes-ko-eek, “calling for food” [[unknown]at-[unknown]xa[unknown]yís qu[unknown]í[unknown][unknown]x, “inviting to eat”], or “calling together for food.” The host spoke of the dead, and as food was put in the fire by the Na-ka-nee, the names of the dead were called out, for it was believed that their spirits were present and that they heard their names and benefited by the gift [of food], not only spiritually, but in some material way that cannot be explained. The leader might sing the songs of the old shamans of the family [lineage] at this time, asking for good weather. Then the feast dishes were brought out and placed before the guests and filled with food: dried salmon and grease, berries in grease, seaweed, salmon or herring spawn in grease; and beaten-up soapberry was always served last and was most esteemed. The two sides [rival groups of guests] might eat in competition with each other; individuals might be selected to do so, and he who ate the most, however sick it might make him, honored the host the most. In the afternoon [after the feasting], the guests dressed and returned [to the house of the host]. They divided into two sides, one dancing in the afternoon, and the other in the evening. These dances were to show respect to the host and gratitude for the food. They were theatrical and were usually copied from foreign peoples, whose dress and movements were imitated, and the words to the songs were in their languages. Each side sang four songs. Great care had to be exercised not to exceed this number, nor to offend their rivals in reffering to their crests, for all were highly excited, and a minor incident was likely to cause a clash resulting in bloodshed and a feud."
217,"Minor potlach. The feasting and dancing that preceded the distribution of property might continue for several days. After dressing in their houses, each family formed a separate procession, and, headed by a drum, marched to the feast house where, one at a time, they danced into the house in a stooping posture, jumping up and down in quick jerks and shaking the rattle, or moving their arms spasmodically. The dancer moved his head very slowly after entering and danced to one side of the house, where all were finally assembled in many lines. The song accompanied by the drum, the rapid movement of the bodies in varied dress, the air filled with light eagle down, the nervous expectancy of both the host and his guests that some old feud might break out through intention or want of control, all combined to make a never-to-be-forgotten scene.

Those of the opposite phratry—the family of the host’s wife—brought the property in blankets, including the loan. These were counted, piled, and marked by the host’s wife. These, together with the property that the host and his family expected to distribute, were placed in piles to one side of the entrance. After the host, in a long speech, had related his family history, and had taken a new name, that of his predecessor if a chief, or of some ancestor on his mother’s side [i.e., in his own line], he would likewise give new names to his “grandchildren” from the same source, and give the end of his staff to the slaves he was freeing. The distribution of property was [then] made by the Na-ka-nee . The giver [contributor of specific blankets or other goods] was privileged to select the recipient [among the guests of the opposite moiety] and to name the particular dead person in whose honor the gift was made. This distribution served to discharge all obligations to those who dressed the dead, carried out the corpse, performed all the offices of cremation, carved the totem pole, built the gravehouse, or the house. All of these were paid, and old debts of long standing might likewise be discharged."
218,"Major Potlach. This differs from a minor potlach because it involves guest from another tribe, rather than just from within the village. Those invited select two leaders for the songs and dances which they practice every night when they camp [on the way to the potlatch]. These leaders must fast for two days and keep away from women. It was the invariable custom that visitors, whether invited or not, should never come directly to a strange village, but should land and camp the preceding night at some distance, the place being designated by the host’s friends, who met them bringing food. That night the guests might man their canoes and pretend to attack the village with loud cries and the beating of their paddles on the gunwales of the canoes, and then return after the [host] village had been thoroughly aroused, for in early days villages were attacked at night, and even when expecting such a play, the people would become greatly excited. The next day the guests would don their dance costumes, paint their faces in red and black, and line would slowly paddle toward the village of their hosts, the occupants singing. Stopping in front of the chief’s house, the canoes would be held afloat, just clear of the shore, by paddles and poles, and families of their phratry, residents of the village, who were likewise guests, would assemble on the beach in ceremonial dress, dancing and singing their family [clan] songs, in honor of the host and in part as a welcome to the visitors. The host would then appear and a pantomime would be enacted by him or his family. This pantomime was highly spectacular and generally illustrative, both in dress and action, of the crest animal. After this, the chief of the visitors, standing in the stern of his canoe, would speak, and when finished, would be answered from the shore by the host, who would end with an invitation to land. Then the canoes would separate, turn, and back in [stern first] in front of the houses designated for their reception, when those on shore would rush into the water and unload them. For the next 5 days the guests are fed and given blankets, to show their respect and thanks they dance for the hosts, who never dance at their own potlach. Veniaminov ([1840] (1984:421-23) wrote that the major potlatch, the Khatashi “to raise the dead”. When the guests were assembled, the festival would begin with songs and dances, from the evening until dawn, followed by an excellent feast for the guests only. Singing, dancing, and feasting continued for several days, as long as the host could feed his guests. On the last evening, the chief of the hosts would retire and don the “sacred regalia” of his clan, which were reserved for such occasions, and could never be worn at other times, except when the Sitka natives danced onboard Russian ships. Veniaminov further specified that the Tlingit of the “Wolf Clan” had as their “sacred regalia” the skin of a wolf, complete with tail, paws, and head, and with teeth made out of wood or even copper. The Frog Clan (Kiks[unknown]adí, Raven 10) had a wooden hat with a frog on it and a cloak (blanket) with the figure of a frog. As the chief, wearing these things, stepped forward, accompanied by several slaves, someone outside would howl like a wolf or croak like a frog (i.e., utter the cry of the totem), the tone indicating whether slaves were to be freed or killed, and how many would die, matters already settled in advance. The slave who dressed the chief was always freed, so the chief would select this favorite. Then the hosts sang their clan songs, telling their clan history and the deeds of their ancestors. After this, the chief would be seated, the presents for the guests brought out. These were not distributed equally, for the most honored and wealthy received the most and the best, even slaves, while common people were given less. Next day the same festival would be held at the next house, and after that at the next, if the festival had been organized by the whole village (by houses of the same moiety in the village). At such potlatches, men of the host clan had the right to assume the name or title of deceased kinsmen. (We suppose they had to be wealthy men who had made significant contributions.) Chief’s wives also could take new names."
219,"Ceremony for the children. Held only very rarely because of the considerable expense it entails. Whereas the expenses of the wake and of the potlatch could be recovered when the donor was a guest of his “opposites,” at the children’s festival he was giving to members of his own clan, his children’s “opposites,” and therefore could never hope to recover his outlay. For this festival a new house was always built, but the workers were from both moieties, and all were paid; and at the ceremony held in the new house the ears of the children were pierced. The ceremony would last a minimum of four days. The out-of-town guests would arrive the first day. The children to be honored would be placed at the rear of the house, the host’s clan-mates in the center, the visitors on the right side, the local guests on the left. Each group would sing two songs, go out to dress, and return to dance two dances. Then the host would feast them, his clansmen acting as waiters. On the night of the second day the host would lead eight songs. The two groups of guests each danced twice. On the third day was another feast, and that night all the groups, the host’s clan, visiting guests, and local guests, might each give special theatrical performances. On the fourth day the ears of the children were pierced by the highest ranking chiefs among the guests. If the children were tattooed—girls on the hands, boys on the hands and chest—this might take several days. few days later some or all of the children would be given new names, the history of which would be explained. Then followed the distribution of gifts: the chiefs who had done the ear piercing or tattooing would receive the most, but something went to each person who had sung or danced."
220,"Girls initiation. On the occurrence of the first menstrual discharge the girl tells her parents, who weep over her. She must then go and bathe in the sea for an hour or two by herself. All ornaments are removed from her, only a single belt of Pandanus leaf being left, with an apron of cainyo leaves. Strips of Pandanus leaf are attached round her arms near the shoulders and round her wrists, and others are placed as bands crossing her chest from the shoulder to the waist on the opposite side, and crossing her abdomen from the iliac crest on the one side to the trochanter on the other. Thus covered with leaves the girl must sit in the hut allotted to her, with her legs doubled up beneath her and her arms folded. A piece of wood or bamboo is placed at her back for her to lean against, as she may not lie down. If she is cramped she may stretch one of her legs or one of her arms, but not both arms or both legs at the same time. To feed herself she may release one of her hands, but she must not take up the food with her fingers; a skewer is provided for this. She may not speak nor sleep for 24 hours. Her wants are attended to by her parents and their friends, who sit near her to keep her from falling asleep. The girl sits thus for three days. Early every morning she leaves the hut to bathe for an hour in the sea. At the end of the three days she resumes her life in the village. For a month following she must bathe in the sea every morning at dawn. During the ceremony and for a short time afterwards the girl is not addressed or spoken of by name, but is referred to as Alebe or Toto. On the occasion of this ceremony the girl is given a new name, her “flower-name,” and from this time till after the birth of her first child she is never addressed or spoken of by the name which she had as a child, but only by the name given to her at this ceremony."
221,"When the friends and relatives of a boy decide that he is old enough to have the incisions made in his back a dance is held in the evening, and the boy is required to dance through the whole night till he is tired. As soon as morning breaks he is made to bathe in the sea for two hours or so. He is then seated in some convenient place, not in a hut. The boy kneels down and bends forward till his elbows rest on the ground in front. One of the older men takes a pig-arrow and with the sharpened blade makes a series of cuts on the boy's back. Each cut is horizontal, and they are arranged in three vertical rows, each row consisting of from 20 to 30 cuts. When the cutting is finished the boy sits up, with a fire at his back, until the bleeding stops. During the operation and for a few hours following it the boy must remain silent. There is no treatment of the wounds to produce raised scars"
222,"Part 1. Officiant takes some turtle fat and rubs it first over the lips and then over the whole body of the youth, while the female relatives of the latter sit near and weep loudly. When the youth's body is thoroughly covered with fat the man who is performing the ceremony takes some burnt oxide of iron, such as is used for making red paint, and rubs it over the youth's whole body, except the hair of his head. He then takes a piece of turtle fat and places it in the youth's mouth, feeding him thus with a few mouthfuls which the youth eats in silence. Officiants massages patient He first stands behind him and placing his hands on his shoulders presses down on them with all his weight. Then he seizes a roll of flesh on each side of the youth's beily and shakes it up and down. The arms are next massaged and the wrists and knuckles are forcibly flexed so as to make the joints “crack.” The legs are similarly massaged, either with the hands or with the feet, the officiant standing on the outstretched legs of the youth and rolling the muscles beneath his feet. The joints of the toes are forcibly bent with the hand to make them “crack” if possible. A mixture of clay and water has been prepared and spattered over the youth's body from head to foot, either by holding his hands near the youth and clapping them together, or by jerking the clay off his fingers with a flicking motion. During the whole of these proceedings the youth sits passive and silent."
223,"Part 2. The food tray containing turtle meat and fat, cut into small pieces, is placed beside the youth and he is provided with a skewer of wood , as he may not touch the meat with his fingers. He must sit in the same position with legs outstretched and arms folded and surrounded with Hibiscus leaves. To feed himself he may unloose one arm, and when his legs are cramped he may double them up beneath him. He may not lie down nor speak nor sleep for 48 hours. During this period he may eat nothing but turtle and drink nothing but water. On the morning of the third day a belt and necklace are made of pieces of the creeper, these are placed round the youth's waist and neck. On this day he is permitted to sleep. Either on the same day, or early the next morning, he has a bath in the sea, to remove some of the red paint and clay, and he is then decorated with red paint made of red ochre and turtle fat, and with white clay ( tol-odu ). The red paint is put on in stripes over his body, and his ears are daubed with it. The youth comes out from his hut and stands in the middle of the dancing ground, and five or six men stand round him in a circle, each of them facing towards the youth. Each of the men, including the youth, holds in each hand a bundle of twigs. The man at the sounding-board sings a song, beating time with his foot, in the usual way, on the sounding-board, and at the chorus the women join in and mark the time by clapping their hands on their thighs. Each dancer flexes his hips so that his back is nearly horizontal. He raises his hands to the back of his neck so that the two bundles of leaves in his hands rest on his back. With knees flexed he leaps from the ground with both feet, keeping time to the beating of the sounding-board, which is about 144 beats to the minute. At the end of every eight jumps or so, the dancer brings his hands forwards, downwards and backwards, giving a vigorous sweep with the bundles of leaves, which scrape the ground at each side of his feet, and then brings back the bundles to their former position. They dance thus for 15 or 30 seconds and then pause to rest. The dance is repeated several times, until the youth is tired out. As the dance is extremely fatiguing. The youth then returns to his hut and resumes his former position. He may now, if he wishes, talk to his friends and he may sleep. He must retain the bundles of leaves, the necklace and belt of Pothos leaves. The dance is repeated in on the two days following, and after that the youth resumes his ordinary life. For a week or two he may not touch a bow and arrow. The Pothos leaves are worn till they are faded and are then discarded. The paint on the body wears off and is not renewed, but his ears are kept painted with red paint. For some weeks the youth is supposed to be in an abnormal condition and is carefully watched by his friends. At the turtle-eating ceremony a new name is given to the youth. This name, however, never seems to be used afterwards."
224,"“The shedding of tears.” The object of this ceremony is to release the mourners from the restrictions that they have had to observe. The ceremony takes place in the evening. The mourners, male and female, remove the odu clay from their foreheads and decorate themselves with red paint and white clay. They also put on what ornaments of Pandanus leaf or netting and Dentalium shell t. When all the members of the camp are assembled around the dancing ground one of the male mourners takes his stand at the sounding-board and sings a song. This song does not refer in any way to the dead man or woman. Those women who are not in mourning sit near the singer and take up the chorus. When the song is fairly started the mourners, male and female, begin to dance. There is nothing special about the dance. After dancing for a short time the mourners seat themselves at one end of the dancing ground and their friends begin to weep and wail. Everybody present joins in the lamentation until they are tired. The mourners then rise and again dance. After a time the women retire and seat themselves with the chorus, but the men continue the dance (in which they are joined by the other men present), till they are tired, which often means till near dawn."
225,"Weather rite. According to the account given of this rite, which is called “killing the cicada,” its purpose is to produce fine weather. It takes place in December, at the end of the season during which they eat the grub. When the time agreed upon for the performance of the ceremony arrives, all the members of the community are careful to be in the camp before sunset. As soon as the sun sets and the cicada begin their shrill cry, all the men, women and children present begin to make as much noise as they possibly can, by banging on the sounding-board, striking the ground with bamboos, beating pieces of wood together, or hammering on the sides of canoes, while at the same time shouting. They continue the noise, which entirely drowns that of the cicada, until after darkness has fallen. The rite may be performed, I believe, two or more times, on successive evenings. My informant explained the rite by saying that the natives have been eating the cicada, and the rite is intended to “kill” those that are left. After the rite the cicada disappears and is not seen or heard for some weeks, and there follow four months of fine weather with little rain."
226,Naming ceremony. Barber cuts face marks and removes childs uvula. Mallam recites prayers and the Koran is read. The child's name is announced and the senior mallam leads everyone in prayer
227,"The body is washed, wrapped in a white cloth and placed on a bier, and then taken out to the burial grounds by the men. Prayers are said continually and the family mourns officially for forty days by saying special prayers and remaining close to home. During the ceremony men remain impassive, quietly counting their beads and praying softly to themselves. Women, on the other hand, come in groups walking slowly in single file wailing and crying, especially if the deceased is a close neighbor, friend, or relative. If a man is needed for a short communication, a woman might stop wailing suddenly, talk in an ordinary voice, then just as quickly resume her keening. A few women at every funeral were observed who were much more totally involved and did not break up their wailing when asked to do something else. Sometimes these wails of the women become songs with words. This is less true at funerals of men where if it happens the song or chant says over and over again, “He was a good man.” For a dead woman the words are also, “She was a good woman,” but an added verse, especially if the dead woman was not very old, refers to the hard life of a woman and how long and unending are her chores. There is a definite implication here that the heavy burdens of womanhood can bring an early death."
228,"Ngum Ashembe marks the end of Ramadan. The first night of festivities, includes continous drumming and the firing of guns. In the morning large numbers of people gather for communal prayer at specially erected tent."
229,"Ngumri Laya or Salla Laya. This is the festival at which sacrifice of a ram is made, corresponding to the Hebrew festival of Pesach and the Christian Easter. Salla Laya was celebrated on July 9, 1957. The first ram sacrificed is the Shehu’s ram in Maiduguri, a special ram with black rings about his eyes. In Maiduguri a great festival marked by communal prayer attended by the Shehu accompanies the sacrifice of this, the first ram. The Liman says the words “Bismillahi” (in the name of Allah) as he cuts the ram’s throat, and the blood pours into a basin or shallow hole. In Maiduguri people rushed forward to dip their fingers into the blood and transfer it onto their face, as the blood is considered blessed. After the Shehu’s ram has been sacrificed, rich men return to their homes and sacrifice their own rams. The meat is then distributed to the poor, and the people of one’s ward"
230,"The wedding itself is very brief. It is presided over by a Malam, before many witnesses. The Malam asks the names of bride and bridegroom, asks them if they wish to marry, reads a section of the Koran. Then all pray, and the ceremony is ended as kola nuts ( goro ) are distributed to all present, and gifts are given to Malam and luwali. That evening, the husband’s closest friends come to the bride’s house to take her to the house of her husband. While her friends cry and try to hold her back, the husband’s friends take the bride off by horse, and leave her at her husband’s house. One friend of the girl refuses to leave her until the husband pays fugurum (or ferorum), which is the set amount of thirty shillings, alike for rich and poor. Fugu means hymen. The friend keeps several shillings of the fugurum for herself and gives the remainder to the mother of the bride, payment to her for protecting her daughter’s virtue"
231,"Candomblé possession cult. the dance began, and the ritual was conducted in the usual order. It started with the drumming for the gods in a certain sequence, which was to be followed by adarrum, the call for the gods to descend. Usually this would only happen after about two hours of dancing, when the mediums would then begin to fall into trance"
232,"The festivals which take place in Vila Recôncavo are based on the religious calendar and are participated in to a great extent by the African cult members. January 1 is an important date in town and is celebrated by a Mass in the fishermen’s chapel, after which the priest goes out on the beach and blesses all the canoes. After he has gone, the participants in African cults make their offering for the day. This is the date when presents are given to the Mother of Waters. The presentations are made by the cult priestesses, but anyone who wants to give a present to the Mother of Waters may do so by handing the gift to the cult priestess beforehand. The presents may consist of money or of anything a woman can use, as long as it is white: combs, ribbons, powders, perfumes, soaps, flowers, and so on. Everything is wrapped together and placed in a large clay basin covered with white cloths and decked with white flowers. The cult priestess comes out of the cult house after Mass and, accompanied by participants and onlookers, goes down to the beach and enters one of the large canoes prepared for the occasion. The cult drummers accompany her, as well as most of the female devotees. Usually two presents are given, one to the young Mother of Waters, larger one to the old Mother of Waters, who lives at about an hour’s distance from town, where the water is very deep. The canoes take off and proceed up the river, while the drums beat and the devotees sing. The Mother of Waters is called and praised, and when the canoes arrive where the younger one lives, her present is lowered into the water. At this moment the Mother of Waters is supposed to enter the body of the person who placed the gift in the water. This person, usually an older devotee, enters a trance state and must be held in the canoe by the others, for she tries to jump into the water. At the same time, all those present in the canoe scoop up the water and pour it over themselves, for it is at this moment quite holy. The possessed person is gradually calmed and brought back to a normal state as the canoes move up the river. The second offering is made."
233,"Corn-offering ritual. Small particles of the boiled corn are offered to the two outer doorposts. Some is also offered to each of the four inner posts, to the fireplace, etc. Then the corn is dipped out into the eight bowls in the prescribed manner. The south priest again rises, goes to the kettle, takes a buffalo horn spoon, and dips up a spoonful of corn. He offers the corn in the same order to the outside lodge posts. Instead of going outside he makes motions toward the different posts and toward the various positions of the gods and drops the corn at the fireplace. He goes around the fireplace, on the north side, to place corn on the rim of the fireplace in front of the buffalo skull. Then he puts his hands on the corn, rubs them together, and passes them four times over the skull from the nose up over the horns. Then he moves up, comes to the place between the fireplace and the altar where the pathway is and touches it; he walks up and touches the altar and the sacred objects on it. He passes the bowl of corn to the people, and they eat. Then the next kettle is brought in and handled in the same way, and so on, until the contents of all are eaten."
234,"Meat offering, occurs after corn offering. After they have eaten the corn, it is time to cut up the meat, put it in the kettle, and boil it. When all the meat is put into the kettle, a piece of it and a piece of fat are put in a wooden bowl and given to the head priest, who cuts it into 16 pieces, one for each stick. He then tells the offering man to make the same offering as with the corn (i.e. offering it to different lodge posts). He does so, but does not give any to the buffalo skull; nor does he touch it, but touches the bills of the birds in the bundle, Mother Corn, and the gourds. He makes the same motions as before, swinging his arms out toward the entrance. After that, all say, “ Rawa ""."
235,"Thunder or bundle renewal ceremony. The Thunder Ritual may be comprehended under six headings: (1) the creation of the world, (2) the smoke offering to Tirawahat, (3) the song to the Wonderful Being who vitalizes the earth, (4) the song for the people (5) the pipe smoked, and (6) the feast. Bundles are opened each spring and songs describing the steps of creation (gods first speaking, the life of the first man) are sung. The songs are sung in a gradually falling pitch which is said to be an imitation of the thunder."
236,"The Corn Planting Ceremony. After a day and night of preparation the ritual begins as the priest takes his seat. He hands gourd rattles to the other priests, reserving one for himself. Then he begins to sing. At the first song, the women stand ready to scrape the earth with their hoes, their right feet forward and hands outstretched. They sing the first four woman’s steps and pause. Then they sing and dance, making motions with the hoes. After the first two songs are sung they pause, and the girls and young women who have borrowed pipes and pouches from their grandfathers return the pipes to their grandfathers. When a man receives the pipe, he has to give something either to the girl or the people at the altar, place something at the altar or present some food. Then he will tell some of his brave deeds: how many times he has counted coup, taken scalps, etc. He narrates all of his successes and jests at the girl about her being “successful” in life. In the dancing, a few men use bows and arrows. When the women step out with their right feet and right hands extended, the men step out with bows and arrows, aiming at something as if to shoot. During the dance these men move back and forth among the dancers; and wherever they see a woman nearly exhausted, they go up to her and rub up against her as would a buffalo bull. When the dance is over, the officiating priest asks if everything is all right. They look at the ground where they have been dancing and see rolls of shredded buffalo hair scattered over the ground, and they know everything is all right; they are not only going to be successful in buffalo hunts, but there is going to be plenty of corn. This success is assured because there are rolls of buffalo hair scattered over the lodge."
237,"Young Corn plant ritual. The head priest, who is still seated at the altar, takes up his rattle and begins to sing the first song, which concerns going for the plant. As he sings, the procession moves out of the lodge toward the field. The four priests, marching, take up the song as they fall in behind the man with the pipe, and the errand man with the firebrand brings up the rear. On the journey they sing all 26 of the woman’s steps and then all 30 of the man’s steps, as if it were a long journey. They collect the plant and return to the lodge, when the procession re-enters, it circles the fire four times. The plant is placed in the priest’s hand. He removes the wrapping of buffalo wool, takes out the plant, and places it in front of the altar on the sacred circular place upon the bare earth. Then he fills his own pipe and smokes to the plant. Then the priest announces that a man must be selected to make Mother. As he makes this announcement, he fills his own small pipe and directs the errand man to present it to ""the arrow-maker"" ( the man selected). The errand man passes down and pauses before his seat, holding out the pipe. The arrow-maker sits for a time as if rapt in thought and then reaches for the pipe. At this the whole assemblage cries out, “ Rawa .” All sit in perfect silence as he smokes. Further singing. The arrow-maker blesses himself with the stick. The errand man approaches, taking the stick and repeating the procedure. It then passes to the priest, who fondles it as if it were an infant, while they sing. A woman is found who is breast-feeding. They place before her a wooden bowl of corn. Four times she dips and eats a little corn with a buffalo horn spoon, then returns the spoon to the bowl. The head priest then says, “We want you to give us some of your milk. You are now to expose your breasts to the gods in the heavens.” They tell her to take off her clothing to her waist. The priests take up their rattles and sing the first stanza of the eleventh song. The woman is told to lean back so that she will expose her breast to the sky. They begin to sing the song about her taking hold of the breast. Next the arrow-maker takes up the milk and with a wisp of buffalo wool rubs it over the plant and the entire surface of the stick, being careful not to get any of it into the grooves just painted red. As this proceeds they sing the usual ten steps. The stick is then passed around to all. They speak of it as a voice, the idea being that there is now life in it. When it again reaches the priest, he holds it up and blows his breath upon it, that the spirit of the people may pass into it. When all is in place, the pledger of the ceremony is directed to make a smoke offering, after which sweetgrass is burned and all the objects purified. Then the bundle contents are wrapped in the tanned skin cover and laced with the rope. The stick bearing the corn plant is laid upon the top, but this time the sacred ear of corn is put on the head piece of the robe, and the latter rolled about it, allowing the tip of the corn to show. This is also tied and placed on top of the bundle."
238,"Great Washing Ceremony. Groups of participants are given objects from sacred bundles and all race down to the river, where these objects are washed, once the chief has arrived. The objects are not actually put in the water, but most participants wash themselves and swim. They have a smoke ceremony in which a whiff of smoke is blown over each bundle. The leading priest makes a closing speech, stating that now all ceremonies are closed until the harvest, that everything has been washed and made pure so that the buffalo will not take flight as the hunters journey over the plains. The contents of the bundles are then smudged and wrapped up. The attending priests make the meat offering and serve the food."
239,"Human Sacrifice to the Morning Star. This ceremony lasts over 4 days, with day long songs and smoke purification. It culminates with a girl being tied to a scaffolding, facing east. A small cut is made over her heart, her bloods drips onto a buffalo sacrifice before. This is subsequently burnt. Amidst songs and shouting the whole community shoots arrows into the sacrifice's back. A procession of all the people is then formed and, led by the priest, circles the scaffold and the fire where the meat offering is burning.The participants go back into the ceremonial lodge, where the parfleche of meat and other things are taken out, and they eat."
240,
241,"The preparations for the great fall ceremony were begun while the people were still on the spring buffalo hunt. At this time the leading medicine men selected two members of the society to make two bows and four arrows. When these were completed, they were given to two other medicine men with instructions for one to kill a bull and the other a cow. The animals had to be killed with a single arrow, but it is said that because of the magic powers of the arrows the hunters never failed to do this. The bull’s hide was to be used to cover the head of the water-monster image, the cow’s hide to cloth the figure of the witch woman. Two more buffalo, also a bull and a cow, were then killed in the same way, the hide of the former being saved to make an image of the Morning Star, and that of the latter, to make nine small images which represented the important heavenly gods. When the buffalo had been killed, the bows and arrows were returned to the leading medicine men who placed them among their sacred objects."
242,"On the return from the hunt, the four leading medicine men went to the medicine lodge and ordered that it be cleared for the ceremony. The same lodge seems to have been used for the ceremony year after year, but was occupied as a dwelling between ceremonies. All the beds and other furniture were carried out by the women, and the floor swept. When this had been done, the medicine men seated themselves in front of the lodge altar and sent their errand men to notify the other members of the society. After these had arrived and taken their places, the leaders went to each of them in turn and directed them, in a whisper, to prepare for the ceremony by a four-day fast. Each man, when he received this notification, returned to his own lodge, took his medicine bag, and left the village to spend that time in solitary fasting and prayer. At the expiration of the fast they bathed in the river and returned to the medicine lodge, where each took his appointed place."
243,"On the day following, they went to cut the cedar tree which was to be placed just inside the entrance. When they found a suitable tree, they formed a circle around it, prayed to it, made presents to it of robes and other things, and finally took power from it. When this had been done, they cut it down. As it fell, they began to hypnotize each other and work sleight of hand. They then picked it up and carried it back to the village singing. As they neared the village, a second party of medicine men came out to meet them, and began to hypnotize them and try to drive them back. The party with the tree were more powerful, and gradually drove the others back to the edge of the village. There the tree was laid down, and all the people came and threw offerings on it. These offerings were gathered up, and were finally given to the medicine men. The tree was then taken to the lodge and set up, and its branches were covered with white downy feathers. That night they made the images of the Morning Star and the heavenly gods. These were flat pieces of hide, cut in the outline of a man. The image of the Morning Star was fastened to a long pole and raised above the smoke-hole just before the star rose. The other images were fastened to the tops of the main posts or on a cord running across the upper part of the lodge."
244,"At dawn of the day following that on which the last of the images had been made and set up, the various medicine men dressed themselves to represent their guardian animals and marched, in order of the importance of their guardians, around the outside of the lodge and then around the inside. They did this four times, dancing and imitating the cries and actions of their guardians. They then held a feast in the lodge. That night they once more marched out in procession and visited all the lodges which contained sacred bundles, dancing in each. When they had returned to the medicine lodge, the leaders selected certain medicine men to go through the village once more, visit every lodge, and report if any one was sick."
245,"In the afternoon the medicine men once more dressed to imitate their guardians and came out of the lodge, dancing and performing various sleight of hand tricks. The favorite trick seems to have been to thrust long rods down their throats. They repeated the outside performance four times. That evening they built a great fire inside the lodge and invited all the people to an exhibition of sleight of hand. These performances were repeated every night for a month."
246,"Hunting Initiation. When boy kills his first rabbit, the men form a circle round him holding each other's wrist. A relative takes the boy by the shoulder and bends him forward with his back turned towards the north. The hunt father takes the dead rabbit and swings it across the boy's back from left to right leaving a blood mark on the flesh. This is done for the other three cardinal points, the boy's back being turned toward them anti-clockwise. During the next three days the boy may eat neither salt nor meat. Each morning before sunrise his hunt father takes him to Do˙ji˙′va spring below the mesa to bathe; both are unclothed save for a breech cloth. The father totally immerses the boy in the water four times each morning, gives the boy some of the water to drink and then presents him with four prayer sticks which the boy plants, one at each side of the spring in the four cardinal directions, praying at the same time for health, strength and skill as a hunter. This is done on each of the three mornings. On the morning of the fourth day the boy eats salt and meat in the stew, and a feast is held at his mother's house. He is then taken to the house of his hunt father's mother or sister. His hair is washed and he is given a new name, according to customary naming ritual, by the father's female relatives who also present the boy with gifts of piki and sweet corn food. His hunt father presents the boy with two curved painted throwing sticks and dresses him in white ceremonial skirt, sash, and moccasins. Bells are tied about his waist, necklaces of turquoise are placed round his neck, and a bunch of white eagle and parrot feathers tied in his hair. The boy's body is also painted with a broad yellow line across the chest from shoulder to shoulder and short parallel horizontal yellow lines are painted above and below the elbow of each arm and above and below the knee of each leg. Each cheek is painted with two vertical lines of red ochre. White meal is rubbed over the rest of the face."
247,"Funeral. The body is not washed nor treated in any fashion. After covering the corpse, the man or woman in attendance immediately washes the deceased's hair with yucca suds and ties it up with yucca fiber. The corpse is fixed in a sitting position with flexed knees and arms and tied thus with yucca if necessary. It is bad to keep a corpse in the house. One feather is tied to the corpse's hair, one is placed under each foot “to take the body to the other world,” one is placed in each hand, and one over the navel “which is the place where the breath of a man lives.” No meal is sprinkled nor any prayer said at this time. The face of the corpse is covered with raw cotton, which signifies its future existence as a cloud. Wafer bread and a small gourd of water, lunch for the dead person on his journey, are placed in the pockets made by the flexion of the thighs against the body. The corpse is placed on the ground while the men dig a hole deep and wide enough to receive the flexed body. The corpse is placed in the hole in the sitting interment position, facing towards the west. The hole is rapidly filled in with sand and a stick of any sort is placed on the grave to serve as a ladder for the soul (breath) to depart westward. While the men are away, the woman of the house boils juniper and strains the liquid into a bowl. The men return and wash themselves outside the house with this medicine water. Then all present go through the navo'h DZ i'ïya' rite to purify themselves and propitiate the spirit of the dead so that it will forget the living and not worry them. Members of the household sit in a circle on the floor of the house. In the center of the circle are placed a broken piece of pottery; on another broken piece of pottery a few grains of sand from an ant hill, brought back by the grave-diggers; a hair broom; a small piece of pounded yucca root; the sprigs of juniper previously boiled for the medicine liquid. Each person in turn picks up the hair broom with the left hand and with the broom-end brushes four times a few strands of hair from the top of his head over the broken pottery. Then he takes a pinch of yucca root, again with the left hand, and rubs it four times over the same few strands of hair, from distal to proximal end of the strands; similarly, with the left hand, he applies a section of juniper to his hair. Finally he picks up a few grains of the ant hill sand with his left hand and circles it, anti-clockwise, four times round his head. Each item is replaced in the center of the circle after use. After all have done this, the objects are thrown away outside the house. “This is how all in the house are protected against the spirits.” On the following day, usually early in the morning, the man who made the prayer feathers takes a pottery bowl full of meal and five prayer sticks to the grave. The meal is to feed the spirit of the dead man, the prayer sticks to help it on its journey and to help it easily to become a cloud. At the grave “the man makes a prayer for rain and tells the spirit not to return to the village nor to take anyone else from the village with him on his journey.”"
248,"Chief's ritual smoking for fair weather. First, they pray on the cornmeal. They pray silently, holding the cornmeal to the four directions. Each chief speaks then for his own clan in the order of precedence determined by the origin legend, but he makes no specific reference to it. They then smoke."
249,"Naming Ritual. The mother-in-law prepares some suds of the yucca roots which she has brought. In these suds she washes the two ears of corn, which are usually white. Hereupon she washes the head of the lying-in woman, then her own; the mother's mother then follows, and then the head and body of the child is washed by the father's mother. Sometimes the father and others also wash their own heads. After she has bathed the child, she holds it in her left arm, rubs a little meal on its forehead, cheeks, chin, and into its mouth, and then taking the two corn ears in her right hand she holds them on the breast of the child. . While she does this she says: “To old age your life being preserved, may you become an old man (old woman), but N. N. you shall be named.” Other women have in the mean while come in, each one bringing with her a little water with which she also bathes the child's head and body, giving it a name in the same manner as the grandmother. The child thus receives as many as five, eight, ten, or even more names, only one of which usually “sticks” (húrzhti), as the Hopi say. Each new name is greeted by the mother with “Thanks!” (áskwali!) These-women all belong to the same clan as the mother and child. The child is then rubbed all over with red ochre."
250,"The Momtcit Ceremony. Until the cessation of Indian warfare, the Momtcit ceremony was celebrated annually. Smoke offering opens the ritual. The preparation of the war medicine began early in the afternoon of the first day, with the Pukonghöya impersonator playing the main part. He began by inserting an arrowhead into a plaque filled with water, holding it in place as he sang the required songs. Then he added a pinch of flesh scraped from an enemy scalp, and bits of “hard rock.” As he bent close over the bowl, Pukonghöya shouted loudly from time to time to notify the powerful beasts who “owned” the medicine of the proceedings. Whenever he shouted the assemblage would utter a war-cry. When it was finished, a little of the medicine was drunk by all present, and the rest was mixed with gray clay and rubbed on arms, legs, heart, and back. Initiated members were permitted to apply some of the medicine to outsiders in order to make them healthy and brave. Singing and dancing follows. Meal is sprinkled to the sun. There is stick 'swallowing' by an officiant. the second day is largely the same except that a different sort of stick is 'swallowed' and more men are involved in it"

253,"Nia Ikar (‘The Way of the Demon’) chant, to cure 'insanity'. During the performance of the chant, the walls of the patient’s house are covered with leaves and strips of cloth to obstruct prying eyes, and crosses made of nipar palm stalks are placed around the walls of the house and piled in heaps on the floor to keep the demons away. The women characteristically paint their cheeks with a brilliant coat of achiote paste to frighten the demons away. Achiote paintings of humanoid figures with spikes instead of limbs adorn the doors and houseposts; and a white flag decorated with the same figures is often flown from the roof top to scare the demons and to warn passersby from venturing too near. Inside the house, and occasionally outside on the street, Spanish peppers, termite nest, barbasco, and other foul-smelling plants and materials are burned to ‘confuse the road’ the demons have opened to the victim. The Way of the Demon’ is usually repeated at least four times over the same number of days to ensure maximum effect"
254,"Apsoket (‘Conversing’) ritual. involves the entire community in one way or another and spans eight intensive days, together with several more after the major part of the ritual has been completed. The most common purpose of the ceremony is to rid the village of ponikana which have either been threatening or ravaging the populace with disease on an epidemic scale. 50 tall figures, each about five or six feet in height, are carved from balsawood trunks. The spirits of these 'shaman' figures are to be the leaders in the campaign against the ponikana who are threatening the village, and they in turn are given a chief, who is also made of balsawood, yet is somewhat taller than the rest. before the ceremony begins each household prepares itself with a surplus of food, for during the chanting the village is completely sealed off; no one is allowed to leave, and visits from neighboring villagers are strictly prohibited. All trading boats by Colombia and Panama are warned against docking, and air traffic to the village is discontinued. When all the preparations have been made, the ceremony begins. Adult males in the village are required to sit in the tobacco smoking house for the duration of Apsoket Ikar , which lasts eight consecutive days, from late afternoon until about midnight. The chant begins with a lengthy description of the problems at hand, the ponikana who are responsible. Numerous other spirit helpers are called to assist the balsawood shamans, including river agates, chile peppers, nuckukana of all types, bees, armadillos, sealing wax, plants with spines, nets, and vines. During the second day, chanting is aimed at bringing the medicines to life. As each medicine is mentioned, the assistants of the Apsoket chanter place it on hot coals in the clay braziers. The spirits of the medicines, transformed through incineration, comprise the key ingredients for a powerful intoxicating chicha ( inna ) which the shamans will carry into the underworld to offer to the ponikana and render them helpless. Another potent ingredient is the spiritual essence of the tobacco the men in the hall are smoking. Chants summon hosts of shaman spirits, counsel them, and prepare them for journeys into the levels of the cosmos; they contain accounts of expeditions to the domains of the spirits causing the illnesses being treated; and they describe confrontations between the chanter’s shaman helpers and the illness-causing spirits, which leads to successful resolution of the problem at hand. Finally, they end with descriptions of the shaman spirits as they ‘stand vigil’ over the patient to guard against further incursions of ponikana."
255,"Girls’ puberty rites—called inna rites. The puberty festivities are the only occasions on which the Kuna are permitted to drink alcoholic beverages in large quantities. Ritual occurs in the ‘ inna house’ which is kept closed during most of the year. Before the ritual can take place the inna must be brewed, when it is decided that the inna is ready to drink, the rites and festivities begin. A special enclosure is constructed for the young girl outside the ‘ inna house’ and she is placed within this enclosure and buried in the sand with only her head above ground. Within the enclosure, the iet (haircutter) and her assistants cut the girl’s long hair according to prescribed techniques. The women perform the nonverbal aspects of the ritual; the men perform the verbal. The rites include various official activities which are performed only on these occasions, as well as various unofficial activities which are associated with the festivities. One of the important official events is the selection of a secret nuka sunnat (true name) for the girl by the kantule. Central to the whole affair is the performance by the kantule and his student-assistants in the ‘ inna house'. These individuals, both standing and sitting or lying in a large hammock, two at a time shout the very long kantule ikar (the way of the kantule), shaking rattles and blowing on the long flute ( kammu ) as they shout. The members of the community who are present in the ‘ inna house’ do not listen to the shouting of the kantule. They are typically quite drunk and involved in many sorts of activities. However, they are aware of the general content of ‘the way of the kantule ’ and of its purpose and significance—they know that successful completion of the puberty rites depends on its performance and that they should be present."
256,"‘The Day of the Red Dance.’ As dawn breaks, all the people assemble outside their facing east. Four elders chant a prayer calling on every man to love his neighbour, and the crowd then call ‘Hoi-yoor’ three times--a form of ‘amen.’ In the centre of the arena--about 70 yards across--some long poles were ‘set up’ in the ground. To the tops of these were tied some of the ostrichfeather headdresses which Masai muran like to wear; and on the branches of nearby trees were more of these and also a number of the conical hats made from lions' manes--not unlike guardsmens' bearskins--which are worn on ceremonial occasions by those who have killed a lion with a spear. The dancers gather together into groups of a dozen or more, all facing inwards towards a small open space. One young man steps forward into this space, makes a few prancing dance steps, and then starts to jump perpendicularly up and down, his long hair flying up above his head into a kind of halo at the top of each jump. Meanwhile the other dancers chant and grunt, awaiting their turn to jump. Now and then this type of dancing was abandoned and the dancers formed up to single file, going in procession back and forth across the centre of the manyatta . As the number of dancers increased, the young men became more and more excited and soon a number were throwing fits. Foaming at the mouth, eyes staring, arms rigid at right angles to the body the sufferers stagger wildly about until friends come to their aid and hold them down. These fits are caused by the habit of drinking an infusion of the bark of certain trees, a relic of the old cattle-raiding days, for when the fit has passed the sufferer loses all fear and is ready for battle."
257,"The Day of the White Dance.’ Soon after sunrise the muran went off into the bush to paint their bodies with diatomite. This white, chalklike substance is brought on foot from the Eburru Mountains near Naivasha in The Rift Valley. To bring it, two senior muran of good character are chosen, and they go off dressed in women's clothing and ornaments, carrying bamboo staves and cattle-branding tools as a sign that they are on a peaceful errand. Nearing the destination they stalk the diatomite as if it were game. Then they give the warcry of old: ‘I am the son of So-and-So,’ and ‘I am the Son of Such-and-Such’ and drive their branding irons into the outcrop. They fill their gourds with it and then return home and are treated with great reverence at Masai villages en route , being fed on a hot mixture of milk and water, known as ‘blue water.’"
258,"The Day of the White Dance.’ Once painted, the young men formed into two columns, some so yards apart, and marched to the village. Many wore ostrich headdresses and some the lion-mane caps. Around their necks and waists they wore gaily coloured lengths of calico and beaded thongs secured crescent-shaped bells to their thighs. The clashing of the bells was deafening. This return journey to the village is carefully planned so that the young men do not have to walk through or near any water or cross a stream. On nearing the village, the columns counter-marched, then joined together into double file and entered the arena. As they passed, their mothers called out: ‘Endopok !’--‘May you survive!’--but many of the women were busy attending to those throwing fits. There were a number of very violent ones as soon as the columns had passed within the circle of houses. Then the columns split up into groups and marched back and forth across the arena, each group led by an elder blowing a kudu horn (one of the very few Masai musical instruments). Now and then two groups would halt and, forming line, kneel and bow to one another; or to the O-Singira hut. Late in the afternoon of this day the mothers of the 49 ‘pure ones’ shave their sons' heads. All the hair, eyebrows included, is removed by means of a spatulate Masai razor. Milk is used in place of soap. Whilst being shaved, each young man squats in front of his hut on the ceremonial hide on which, as a boy, he had sat to be circumcised, and which, in future, will form the top layer of his mother's bed. A little of the hair from the Ol-Otuno and his lieutenant is also put in their mothers' beds, the remainder being thrown into the calf pens which form a part of their family home. Great care is taken that none is left lying about in the open in case birds should use it for their nests--a grave affront to the young men's sacred role."
259,"The third day is called ‘The Day of the Sacred Hut.’ During the morning a heifer, a gift to the Ol-Otuno from his father, is driven into the bush and slaughtered. This animal, called ‘The Cow of the Rings,’ must be a first-calver, well built, and black with a white bclly. All the muran gathered at the slaughtering place to receive their rings from ‘The Cutter-up of the Hide,’ whilst their families waited in the village in an atmosphere of great expectancy. Late in the afternoon the first of the muran , naked and still whitened with diatomite, came running back to his hut. There be received a deafening welcome from his family, whom he then led in a boisterous procession round and round the sacred hut. Soon, the whole arena was full of muran leading their families round the O-Singira , everyone shouting and highly excited. Each young man wore, on the third finger of his left hand, a ring from the hide of the Ol-Otuno's heifer. These rings are really only strips of hide about four inches long with a hole near one end to take the wearer's finger. After a time, the ‘pure’ arrived, their shaven heads gleaming, white circles of diatomite like spectacles round their eyes and garlands of green leaves round their necks. They stood in a group near the O-Singira whilst the Ol-Otuno was led to his hut. In front of his doorway was placed the hide on which he had sat to be shaved, and on this was set his three-legged stool, and into its concave seat was poured a mixture of water, milk and honey."
260,"Circumcision (E-murrata) Boys' circumcision ceremonies take place at intervals of about three years. Circumcision begins with the shaving and bathing of the initiate; in the afternoon after this has been done an ox or sheep is killed and eaten by the warriors and elders of the neighborhood. On the second day, the boy cuts a tree which the girls of the kraal carry to the door of the hut [in which the boy sleeps?], where it is planted. On the third morning the boy gets up early and sits outside to get cold; after sunrise he is circumcised, he should not flinch or show any pain whilst being operated on. from the fourth to the seventh day he remains at home, and then goes out, shooting with blocked arrows at the girls, and with other arrows at small birds which he wears hung from his head. This is his occupation till he has recovered: during this time he is known as o-sipolioi and wears the dress of a married woman, including the i-surutia ear-rings, and an ostrich-feather on his head. After recovery he is shaved, given weapons and warrior's clothes, and becomes ol-barnoti , “the shaved one,” i.e., a junior warrior"
261,"Ordination of Buddhist priest. The aspirant monk is usually very nervous and is likely to make mistakes in the recitation or to forget the text altogether. If this occurs, the ordained will prompt him with the appropriate key word until the text comes back into his mind. If he still cannot recollect the right words he will be guided all the way, word for word. This prompting does not invalidate the ceremony"
262,"During the Lenten season the monks chant Pali texts in unison many times a day, sometimes for prolonged periods, but on other occasions the recitation may last only a few minutes. In most monasteries there are four major chanting sessions: at four o'clock in the morning, at nine, early in the afternoon and just before sunset. During the longer chanting periods the monks sit facing a Buddha image, the hands raised palm to palm in front of the chest in orderly rows. The abbot sits in front, the most recent additions to his chapter sit in the back. The abbot indicates which text will be used by chanting the first word of that text. All the monks join in, with loud voices at the same pitch"
263,"On each wanphrâ', four times a month, a numerous lay congregation gathers in the monastery and observes the monks perform certain ceremonial acts which include chanting auspicious stanzas. During all these ceremonies when the members of the Sangha perform a ritual for laymen, the monks sit on a dais facing the laymen. The monks recite Pali texts for a considerable period, sometimes as short as a quarter of an hour, but often much longer, thus causing a bowl of water to be charged with beneficial power"
264,"Meditation. At a sign from the abbot all monks depart from their ‘polite’ chanting position and seat themselves comfortably with the legs folded in front of the body and the hands placed palms upwards in the lap. The abbot then instructs the inexperienced monks in various techniques of meditation. They should close the eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. As an aid to breathing properly, he advises them to think of an auspicious word whilst they breathe. For example, with the auspicious name Buddho, the meditating monks should think of the syllable Bud- while breathing in and of -dho during the exhalation. If the word arahant is used, ara- is reserved for inhalation, -hant to breathe out. Apart from the instruction on purely technical matters, the abbot may introduce a theme upon which to concentrate. Usually he holds a short monologue during which he introduces a subject which will help a monk to obtain the proper attitude towards his environment. The abbot may recite the pañcakakammana, a formula which mentions the five elements that can be found in all creatures: hair on the head, hair on the body, nails, teeth and skin. This also serves to put the monks in the right frame of mind. During the abbot's monologue, all monks sit with their eyes closed, and practice the breathing technique whilst concentrating on the topic the abbot has chosen. When the abbot has finished speaking it becomes very quiet in the bòod; only the sounds from the world outside may penetrate the building. In this atmosphere each monk should try to lower his consciousness while remaining fully alert. The inexperienced monks may find it difficult to relax and remain concentrated. After a few minutes some usually cannot remain quiet; they begin to fidget, look around or feel that they should scrape their throat."
265,"Funeral. As lay guests enter, the host personally receives their contributions and ensures that they are fed .Finally when the temple, filled with people clad in their best, vibrates with the music of gongs, drums, and oboes, the gods and demigods are invited to descend from the heavens to protect the assemblage from danger. Holding the sacred cotton cord that leads inside the bier to the bones, the corps of priests chants sutras for the deceased; the emanations following the sacred cord invigorate his soul. Sermons add to the merit. Now and then the orchestra proclaims to the heavens via loudspeakers that another soul is about to arrive from the earth. During the last night on earth the deceased is diverted by dramatic performances. Next morning he gains further merit through feeding the priests and hearing other sermons. About four o'clock in the afternoon the undertaker removes from the bier a small tinseled box containing the bones of the deceased. A procession headed by chanting priests moves from the pavilion, leading the box by the sacred cord. Kinsmen fall into line behind the priests. The way is short, for the cremation platform, resplendent with carved banana stalks and garlands of flowers, lies nearby in the temple courtyard. Slowly the procession winds around this platform, three times in counterclockwise direction, for the way of death is opposite the way of life. At last the carriers place the box of bones on the pyre, while the priests relinquish the sacred cord. All guests, in approximate order of their eminence, file past the pyre, make final obeisance, and contribute to the pyre the incense sticks and faggots. As each guest descends from the platform, a kinsman hands him a token of gratitude for his work: a handkerchief, a bouquet of flowers, sometimes a book. The guests have gathered in a great circle about the pyre, and the moment to light the fire has come. First some honored guest adds a final increment of merit by giving away another robe to each of the priests in the name of the deceased. Then as the flames rise, the undertaker breaks a coconut and pours its milk over the skull. Soon he is dousing the faggots with water to make the fire burn more slowly. Suddenly a hiss followed by an explosion indicates that a fireworks display has begun; thunderous rockets tell the heavens that a soul has departed from the earth."
266,"One monk conducts services in the wihan for the laity. These services, held at 9:00 a.m. and at 7:30 p.m., consist of readings from the Trajpidok, dealing primarily with the attainment of merit and demerit. These sermons which last about one hour, are written on palmleaf and are known as sermon books or nangsythed. The monk is free to choose his own story. Following the reading, the monk counts the money given by the laity for the reading and announces the amount publicly"
267,"The Kathin ceremony begins at 2:00, with the procession again circling the bod. This time, however, the monks join the procession, along with the sponsors who carry the Kathin gifts. Once in the wihan, the monks take their places on the dais. The sponsor krabs before the abbot and asks (khausin) for the eight Buddhist laws. He holds out the three robes and says in Pali, “I am offering this cloth to the monks of this wat. Please accept it, and may it be of use to you and bring you happiness for all times.” He then places the robes between the khusuad and the abbot. The following part of the ceremony is known as the krankathin, or “the spreading out of the Kathin. ” The abbot answers, saying, “These robes are a very special gift and so must be kept here to be used by all monks and by no one monk in particular.” The abbot retires to the bod, changes into the new phatraj and returns. He leads the saphi -chant of thanks, followed by a chant in which the monks say to the laity, “May those who know the proper time to Kathin receive great merit, and may they also receive health, prosperity, and long life.” During the blessing chant, a cord of holy string is unraveled and passed hand to hand, from the monks to members of the laity sitting near the dais. The end is wrapped three times around the Buddha image. The cord is held between the palms of the hand. Following the chant, the laity ask the abbot to relate the story of the Kathin. After the story, the abbot announces to the monks that the Kathin is officially over and that they should be happy and grateful to have been witnesses to so wonderful a ceremony."
268,"The Phapa ceremonies occur from the end of Lent until the harvest season. In 1953, Wat Banghuad received three Phapas. In contrast to all other ceremonies and rituals, the Phapa is the one occasion where the laity take it upon themselves to remind the monks to purify their thoughts, to remember that material things are only of this world, and that greed and desire must be eliminated. A group of five to ten individuals buys the various materials for Phapa and set out by boat. The boats are decorated with paper flags, streamers, and bananas, so that everyone will know that a Phapa is being taken to some wat. A Phapa may be offered to several wats along the way, but the Phapa, as is the case with the Kathin, is seldom given to the wat in one's own community. When the messenger returns, the donors kneel in front of the Phapa, recite a blessing, and then retire. The abbot arrives with another monk (or two), touches the cloth, and recites a blessing. Only the cloth is touched or looked upon. This, to demonstrate that the monks are not interested in material things. The donors may then approach and ask the monk to offer them a blessing."
269,"Makhabucha: The next Buddhist ceremony occurs on the 15th day of the waxing moon of the third month (February), and is known as Makhabucha. Starting at 9:00 a.m., the monks, in turn, read from four different Buddhist texts, each of one-half hour's duration. At 11:00 they are fed by the laity, and until 1:00 they rest. At 1:00, another series of four readings begins. Sometimes there is an orchestra (piphat) which plays between the readings. It is customary at Wat Bangkhuad to have the abbot on such occasions read the first and last stories. The readings all concern various episodes from the life of the Buddha. Inevitably, the abbot is asked to recount in addition, the story of the origin of the Makhabucha. Prior to each of the readings, the laity place lighted joss-sticks in a sand-filled jar and lighted candles are placed around the rim. At the termination of each reading, small gifts of fruit, tea, cigarettes, salted meat and fish, onions, peppers, kerosene, etc., are laid at the feet of the reader. Money is placed in a special bowl. The average cash donation, per lecture, on these occasions is 10 baht."
270,"The Rice Pagoda Ritual (Khawphrasajkhawphlyag): This ritual, involving the construction of a rice pagoda, is always held in the third lunar month. Each farmer, as he pours his rice on the pile, offers a short prayer in Pali or Thai. Holding lighted joss-sticks and squatting in waj position, he says, “I bring this rice to you, O Buddha, in order to make the pile very high. Please grant me a crop for the coming year that is as good as the one this year.” He then sticks a small triangular red, yellow, or green paper flag into the pile. That evening, or the following day, the dekwat gather the rice, storing most of it in the bod and the remainder in the wat bins. This paddy rice is eventually sold to a Chinese middleman and the proceeds are used for the maintenance of the wat, or for whatever the wat committee decides is necessary. During the afternoon, the great majority of visitors and villagers mill about, chatting, eating, and drinking at the various food and soft drink stalls. They may wander into the wihan from time to time, listen to a part of the sermon, and wander out again. There will be only 25 or so older members of the community who stay in the wihan and listen to an entire sermon, and only half a dozen who remain for a complete morning and afternoon session. This over-all behavior pattern is typical at all large religious ceremonies."
271,"Wissakhabucha: Wissakhabucha is celebrated on the 15th day of the waxing moon of the sixth lunar month (May). It is the last Buddhist ceremony prior to Lent, and perhaps the most important insofar as the people are concerned. It commemorates the last reincarnation, – the death and ascent of Buddha into Nirvana. The monks on this day eat only the morning meal, and many of the laity follow their example. Since there is no noon meal, the readings begin at 11:00 a.m. and continue until 12:30 a.m. the following morning. This reading marathon concerns the 33 lessons dealing with the life cycle of the Buddha. Inasmuch as only four monks can read well, they must each read a total of four hours, half an hour at a time"
272,"Wiantian (circling candles). It takes place at 7:30 p.m. of the same day. Each member who joins the procession carries a khryangbucha. The abbot leads the group three times around the bod, followed by the other monks (in order of seniority), and the laymen. As they circumambulate, they recite a Pali blessing to the Buddha, in which he is thanked for all the things he has taught them. After the third turn, the candles are placed in the small niches of the various sema. The joss-sticks are placed in a receptacle inside the bod. Before entering, the men and women place a shawl or phakhawma across their left shoulders as a gesture of reverence to the Lord Buddha. There are two more readings within the bod."
273,"Special Ritual of the Wat Artist : The wat artist, each time he finishes a set of decorations to be used for the crematory, performs a small ritual. He lights joss-sticks and a candle, then sprinkles holy water (which he has made) on his hair, his face and hands, on the joss-sticks, and finally over the art work itself. This ritual is done to drive off the evil spirits which associate themselves with cremations and death."
274,"Housewarming Ritual ( Khynbanmaj ): Upon completion of the new house, and before anyone may enter, there is another ritual known as the housewarming. When the staircase of the new house has been completed (it being the last item to be constructed), it is blocked off with a rattan cord. No one is permitted to ascend. The abbot is consulted as to the auspicious hour for the ritual which always takes place on a Friday. On Thursday evening, five monks (or more) are invited to suadmonjen. Joss-sticks and candles are lighted, and the holy string is unwound and passed around the house as in the housepost ritual. The rattan barrier on the staircase is broken by the abbot who then recites a short blessing before ascending. The other monks and members of the household follow him up the stairs. The guests remain below. Following the blessing chant, which takes place in the main room, the monks return to the wat. The guests are then served a sumptuous meal and rice whiskey. No one is yet permitted to sleep in the house. The following morning the monks and guests are invited for breakfast, after which the monks recite the hajphaun blessing. Following the blessing, the abbot dips a palm leaf into a bowl of holy water and sprinkles the various rooms, the roof, the walls, and the ground around the house, chanting in Pali as he does so. The guests are now free to enter the house, and the members of the household may take up residence there."
275,"Lojkrathong (Floating Leafcup): The festival starts in the early evening. Since it is a holy day, many of the elders have already gathered at the wihan. The other members of the village gather there at 6:00, each with at least one krathong and many with two or more. Five monks perform a special chant called Mahachad, which depicts the story of the king who gave away his rain-producing elephant and went into exile, thus causing the rains to cease. At 9:00 p. m., the entire group goes down to the canal. The candles in the krathong are lighted, and the little floats are placed in the water and allowed to drift with the current. As they are released, each person offers a prayer, directed to the Goddess of the River, Maekhongkha, and to the King of the Snakes, Phrajanag : “I send with you all my sins and sicknesses that have appeared this year. May you not return to me the following year, but may you bring me health and wealth.” Some farmers may ask for a lucky lottery ticket. From midnight until 12:30 a. m., when the full moon is directly overhead, the canal water is believed to be holy. At this time, the elders of the village go down to the river and bathe. They return with small bowls filled with the holy water and place them in front of their home altars. This water will be used on special occasions."
276,"Thamkhwanjung. An elderly female member of the household performs the ritual. She goes out into the field which offered the best yield, taking with her a large white cloth, a small colored cloth, three khryangbucha, and several small colored flags. In the field, she makes a small doll out of rice stubble. The joss-sticks and candles are lit and placed in the ground. The doll is wrapped in the small colored cloth. Maephosob is then invoked and asked to forgive the farmers for harvesting. The paddy rice has been piled into a large pyramid. Some member of the family has placed, at the base of the storage bins, a young coconut, bean cakes, and a bajsi with a hard-boiled egg (symbol of fertility and life) on top. Some fruit, hair oil, powder, betel, areca palm leaf, lime paste, and a comb have been placed on a large tray and set on the ground next to the bin. The doll is then placed in the basket along with some loose paddy collected from the field. The large white cloth is wrapped around the saraeg and all is carried back to the threshing grounds, where some grain from the threshing floor is now poured into the basket. The paddy rice has been piled into a large pyramid. Some member of the family has placed, at the base of the storage bins, a young coconut, bean cakes, and a bajsi with a hard-boiled egg (symbol of fertility and life) on top. Some fruit, hair oil, powder, betel, areca palm leaf, lime paste, and a comb have been placed on a large tray and set on the ground next to the bin. The grain in the basket is thrown over the doll and the flags are placed at various intervals over the pyramid. The special foods are placed at the base. A young female member of the household has been selected to call or invite Maephosob to partake of the food offering. Joss-sticks and candles are lit and everyone retires to another part of the house until the joss-sticks have burned out, giving Maephosob time to partake of her meal. The children are sent in to collect the trays of food and offerings and to bid Maephosob goodbye. They rush in and happily say, “Goodbye, you have had your fill, so leave us as we eat the rest.”"
277,"Rain-making Ritual: If the rains have not arrived by the beginning of the eighth lunar month (July), the villagers may perform a rain-making ritual. The last such ritual occurred in 1949. Five monks are asked to recite a blessing in the paddy fields. They are given only dry foods to eat and no liquids to drink. The purpose is to torment the monks to the extent that the thewada of rain will take compassion on them. The monks repeat the chanting morning and afternoon for three days, returning to the wat only in the evening. In the wat they are still not permitted liquids or wet foods. On the fourth day, they are served a lavish meal for both breakfast and lunch. In the afternoon, the laity form a procession led by one member dressed as a large female cat. Hence the name of this procession— Haenangmaew. They go from house to house collecting donations of money for the monks who participated in the three-day ritual."
278,"Wâajkhruu ceremony. The young boy should kneel down with his face towards the east, light the candle and incense and offer them together with the flowers to the ‘teachers’, those who in the dim past handed down the knowledge of tattooing. The person who undergoes this treatment should not cry out in pain, lest he be the laughing-stock of all who have suffered stoically."
279,"After a man has received as many tattoos as he wishes, a process which may last several weeks, because of the intermittent periods without tattooing, he must undergo a final effecting ritual. This ceremony is generally known as jóg khruu, literally: ‘to raise the teacher’. This ritual can take place in a monastery, near a Buddha image, sometimes in the most sacred place: on the monks' platform in the bòd. The scene of the ceremony has been made attractive to the non-human powers by the offering of foods that these powers reputedly like: a pig's head, eggs, sweetmeats, candles, incense and flowers. When the powers have been invoked, the 'aacaan sàg will cause them to enter the body of the recently tattooed young person by perfunctorily piercing the skin on top of the skull several times with his tattooing needle."
280,"The Rite of Topknot Cutting. At 10:40 the mother lit candles in front of the Buddhist image(s) and altar(s) carried from the temple for the rite. Chanting a sutra, the priests pull the cotton thread from the Buddhist image(s) inside the room, and hang it on the child's neck for whom the rite is performed. With the man, a cousin of the mother (i.e. the child's mother's father's elder sister's child) as the chairman, the rite is performed. His father is a way from home for some reason. At first there is the chairman's greeting, then chanting sutras by nine priests for ten minutes. At 11:05, the child in white is put in silver chains and the topknot is untied (or cut). At 11:10, the chief priest pours the “lustral water” on the head of the child and cuts the topknot with scissors. Afterwards, the school master shaves the topknot with a razor. And the mother does the same thing after him. A teacher or priest helps them to shave. After the shaving, participants give some money to the child as the present of the ceremony. At 11:15, luncheon is served to the priests. At 11:50, they finish eating. Then, they chant a sutra for five minutes. The ceremony ends with the chairman's speech."
281,"Wajkhru Day is always on a Thursday, usually the first one in June. In many schools, the ritual is preceded by a prayer chanted by a group of monks who have been invited to bless the school and the students. At nine A.M. the children assemble in the reading-office room of the school. Each child brings joss-sticks, candle, eggplant flower, pop-rice, and gras. A student who has been the leader in the four recitations is designated to act as leader in the ceremony. He gathers a large bunch of flowers, joss-sticks, and candles from various students. These are placed upon a special altar erected for this purpose. The altar consists of a simple school table upon which a cloth is laid. A small Buddha is placed on the cloth with two jars on his left for joss-sticks and two on his right for flowers. According to regulations, there should be a small orchestra to accompany the ceremony. The leader of each class carries up a set of books used by the class and places it on the altar. The teachers sit on chairs on both sides of the altar, facing the students. The head teacher stands up, lights the joss-sticks and candles on the table, and begins to recite the Arahangsama. This, in rough translation, is as follows: “I pay respect to the teachings of the Lord Buddha. I pay respect to the monks, the followers of Buddha…” The head teacher then blows out the candles, picks up a set of the books from the altar, and makes the three magic dots on a book ( cymnangsy ) with one of the candles. The purpose is to bestow upon the students a greater power for absorbing knowledge. The candle is then dipped into a special perfumed powder ( paengkacae ) and the sign of the unalom is made on the book. This is repeated with the represented books from the other three classes. Any student who so desires may also have the unalom sign or the cym (three dots) painted on his forehead by the head teacher. The cym is made by dipping the thumb, index, and middle fingers in the paste and applying it to the forehead. This ceremony can also be run by an abbot."
282,"Day 1 and 2. Celebrated every year, since the days of U Shillong who was supposed to be the founder of original Khyriem State, to perpetuate his memory and pay homage with a view to ensure rain, good harvest, eliminating diseases and famine. The commencement of the festival was marked by the distribution of dried, fish (suit dokha) to the persons assembled on the occasion, in the evening of Pamtiah . This was followed by the dropping of rice-beer by the Chief priest over the fire place of central hall known as Ka suit-ka shor in which no sacrifice was made except this libation of this liquor in the name of U Shillong, Ka Blei Long Siem and U Suidnia. Subsequently, the Chief musician (Dhulia) worshipped another deity Ka Synchar, by holding a yellow cock in front of ritual offerings collected on a plantain leaf while his subordinates immediately shouted nine times in their traditional way. Redistribution of dry-fish and indigenous liquor to the people marked and the end of the first day and the ceremonies performed on this day were repeated on the second day."
283,"The third day (Yew duh) on the top of an adjacent hill where the Siem along with other members of his house, went there in a procession. The people shouted all the time while it was preceding to that place. The musicians went round the altar first at the top of the hill thrice in anticipation of a happy and good auguers. The Chief priest facing the north, prayed to U Shillong holding a red-coloured cock in his right hand and killed it on the altar collecting its blood in a gourd vessel. The entrails of the cock were carefully examined by him and then kept on a silver plate. The Chief priest threw some grains of rice before him as also over the yellow goat and prayed to U Shillong holding a dah in his hand. He then passed on this implement to the Siem who also prayed to the deity. The Siem handed over the same to a man (nengnong) who sacrificed the goat on behalf of the Siem. He collected nine pieces of meat from different parts of the goats body ( e.g. heart, lungs, liver, stomach, kidney, etc.) and handed them over to the priest. The latter cut each piece of the meat into five parts and offered them to the five ancestors."
284,"Nongkrem Puja. Fifth day. Sacrifice of over 60 goats by decapitation where possible, otherwise the head must be sawn off. For the first 12 goats chickens are also sacrificed for divinatory purposes. During the night a pig is sacrificed to the honor of the u Suidnia long S'iem and he is informed thereby that Puja has now taken place and that it will take place once annually to the honor of the u Blei Shillong so that the kings will be lucky and healthy, the markets will enjoy progress and good results, and the children of the kingdom will be happy. This closes with the address to the Suidnia long S'iem: “Bring it about that the augury turns out well, and if the god Shillong should still not be satisfied, then reveal it to us through the augury.” The Soh Blei now takes a chicken in his hand, sprinkles it with water, rice, flour of kpu and rynsi and speaks: “Now thou art sprinkled in order to lose thy life by having thy neck cut so that I can see the good or the evil.” Then the animal's neck is cut, the blood, as mentioned above, is allowed to drip on the leaves and the gourd bottle, and the entrails are taken out. After the augury has turned out favorably, a white he-goat is brought in and the Soh Blei speaks: “O god Shillong, this prayer is for thee, this sacrifice of the goat, of the hen, of the kpu and rynsi, of the utensils of preparation are for thee which thou hast given the royal family so that once annually the Puja may be celebrated in thy name, so that we may live happily, be healthy and increase, so that kings will arise so that their honor and that of the kingdom will grow and increase and the children of the kingdom will spread out to increase thy name and thy honor. O god Shillong, when thou hast received the sacrifice, bring it about that the heart, the lungs, the spleen, the gall bladder and the other parts are good.” Meanwhile dancers are arranged on both sides; they swing the sword (ka wait) and the bunch (u symphiah) around in the air and utter shouts of joy. The goat is now strewn three times with the various sacrificial gifts, and guns are shot off three times and shouts of joy uttered. Then the S'iem gets up, takes the ka wait in his hand and sits down on the place of sacrifice. He takes off his turban (ka jain spong) and thanks god three times in a quiet voice; then he hands over the ka wait to the Soh Blei who does the same and then gives the knife to the sacrificer from the jaid Nongkseh, this one hands it on to the one from the jaid Thangkieu, and this one finally gives it to the one from the jaid Niangnong. Only one from these three families may undertake the beheading. When this has taken place, the head is placed on the leaves in front of the gourd bottle, and the entrails are taken from the body in order to read the omens. If these come out right, the dance of joy is set in motion. All members of the kingdom are invited to the feast, which consists of rice, sacrificial meat, and rice liquor and which lasts until early in the morning."
285,"The Rooster Sacrifice, jingknia syiar. A rooster is dedicated to the godhead by strewing it with rice, kiad, kpu, and rynsi. The sacrificer now dips a sharp knife in the sacrificial water that is standing ready and then cuts through the rooster's throat. He lets the blood drip on the altar and on the sacrificial gifts. Now the observation of the entrails begins, which is not always the same but is described as follows since this is the usual way. “The gullet of hens is formed like a fork about in the middle between the neck and the stomach. The right part of the prong is called u Blei (god), the left u briu (man). First the rectum is looked at to see if it is perhaps empty or has any symptoms of a disease or spots. In these cases, the little fowl is unsuitable for sacrifice. But even when everything is without fault, better indications are still wanted. The forking mentioned above is looked at and the sacrificer, holding the intestine in his hand, begins the ceremony with the question: “Nga kylli nga byrthen da ka shat khan, ieng rangbah u briu, dem u Blei?” (I ask and seek by throwing and by oracles, does the man rise and the god bow?) While saying that he sprinkles the forking of the gullet with a little rice with the other hand, whereby because of the convulsive trembling one part or the other actually raises itself. If “the man” raises itself, that is a good sign, since the opposite forking, the “god” then bows or stays still as a sign of agreement.”"
286,"The naming ceremony of the child is performed the next morning after the birth. Fermented rice is mixed with water and is placed in a gourd. Some powdered turmeric is also provided, and is kept ready in a plantain leaf, also dried fish. The earthen pot containing the placenta is then placed in the centre room of the house. If the child is a male, they place near him a bow and three arrows (the implements of a Khasi warrior); if a female, a da and u star , or cane head-strap for carrying burdens. An elderly man, who knows how to perform the naming puja, which is called by the Khasis “ kaba jer khun ,” places a plantain-leaf on the floor and sprinkles some water on it. He takes the gourd in his hand and calls a god to witness. The people assembled then mention a number of names for the child, and ask the man who is performing the puja to repeat them. This he does, and at the same time pours a little liquor from the gourd on to the ground. As he goes on pouring, the liquor by degrees becomes exhausted, and finally only a few drops remain. The name at the repeating of which the last drop of liquor remains adhering to the spout of the gourd is the name selected for the child. Then the puja performer invokes the god to grant good luck to the child. The father takes the pot containing the placenta, after having previously placed rice flour and fermented rice therein, and waves it three times over the child, and then walks out with it through the main entrance of the house and hangs up the pot to a tree outside the village. When he returns from this duty, before he re-enters the house, another throws water over the father's feet. The father, being thus cleansed, enters, and holds the rice flour to his mouth three times. Two people then, holding the dried fish by their two ends, break them in two. The powdered turmeric mixed with rice flour and water is applied to the right foot of the father, the mother and the child receiving the same treatment. The friends and relations are then anointed, the turmeric being applied, however, to their left feet. The bow, arrows, da , and u star are carefully placed inside the inner surface of the thatch on the roof, and the ceremony is over. Rice flour is then distributed to all who are present, and the male adults are given liquor to drink."
287,"Body bathed and laided out on a mat, where it is dressed in white cloth and turban. An egg is placed on the stomach of the deceased, and nine fried grains, are tied round the head with a string. The rich place car-rings in the ears and other jewellery on the body of the deceased. A cock, u'iar krad lynti (literally the cock that scratches the way), is sacrificed, the idea being that a cock will scratch a path for the spirit to the next world. A sacrifice of a bull, or of a cow in case the deceased is a woman, follows. Portions of the left leg of the fowl and the lower part of the jaw of the bull or cow are kept, to be placed afterwards in the bone receptacle. A small basket ( ka shang ) is hung up over the head of the corpse, the basket containing pieces of the sacrificed animals. A dish containing eatables, and betel-nut, and a jar of water are placed near the head of the corpse by way of offering refreshment to the spirit of the departed. . Each night the corpse remains in the house guns are fired, drums are beaten and flutes are played. On the day of the funeral procession pigs are sacrificed by the relatives and friends of the deceased; those who cannot afford pigs bring liquor, a small portion of which they pour on the funeral pyre. The coffin is laid on a bamboo bier, money being placed close to the corpse, so that the spirit of the deceased may possess the wherewithal to buy food on its journey. Cotton, or, in the case of the rich, silk cloths are tied cross-ways over the bier. The funeral procession then forms up and slowly passes along the way to the plaintive music of flutes and the beating of drums. At intervals, in the case of the rich, salutes from guns are fired. Copper coins are also scattered along the route. On nearing the pyre the dead body is exposed to view, and the pieces of flesh of the sacrificial animals, which are with the corpse, are thrown away. fowl, “ u'iar padat,” is sacrificed, its blood being smeared round the pyre three times, and across the corpse three times. The bier is then broken to pieces, the cloths having been removed from it previously. The eatables and the jaw-bones of the sacrificial animals are then placed at the head of the pyre. After the fowl has been sacrificed, the three arrows already mentioned are shot from the bow, one to the north, another to the south, and the third to the east. When the fire has blazed up, another goat, is sacrificed. In some cases all the clothes of the deceased are burnt with the body, in others the clothes are merely held over the fire and then taken away. Before leaving the burning-place the relatives and friends of the deceased place betel-nuts on the pyre and bid farewell to the deceased, saying “ Khublei khie leit bam kwai sha iing u Blei ho ” (good-bye, go and eat betel-nut in the house of god)"
288,"The ceremony attending the removal of the bones and ashes from the small cairns to the larger repository, or mawphew. A lucky day having been thus ascertained, the bones and ashes are brought to the clan puja-house, the bones of males and females being kept in separate bundles wrapped in white cloth, two women of the clan reverently carrying them in their arms, holding the bundles of bones to their breasts. One female carries the bones of the males and the other those of the females. In front of these women walks an old man who scatters along the way leaves of the dieng-shit tree and grains of rice, and when it is necessary to cross any stream or river, he ties a thread from one side of the bank to the other, this is for the spirit of the departed to cross the water. On arrival at the clan puja-house, the bones of the males are laid on one bed and those of the females on another, the beds being bedecked with rich hangings. A cock, u'iar kradlynti (lit.: “the cock which scratches the way”), is sacrificed. A pig, a cock, and a bull are then sacrificed, and portions of the above are offered to the spirits of the deceased. These offerings are placed in a basket which is hung up in the house, together with the left thigh of the fowl and the lower jaw-bone of the bullock. A dance is performed that night, first in the house by two women, one belonging to the clan and the other an outsider, and afterwards in a specially prepared place outside the house called “ lympung .” The sharati, or flute, which is played at funerals is sounded, drums are beaten, and bombs are exploded. This dancing lasts from one to nine days, the limit being always an uneven number of days. At Cherra two effigies called Ka Puron and U Tyngshop are prepared and dressed up; the former is intended to represent Ka Iawbei , the first ancestress, and the other U Suidnia, the first maternal uncle of the clan. These effigies are held in the hands of the dancers. In the meantime two lines of upright stones consisting of three each, with a table stone in front of each line, have been set up. These are called mawkjat or mawlynti , and are intended to serve as resting-places for the spirits of the dead on their way to the tomb of the clan."
289,"The ceremony of placing the bones in the tomb of the clan. Having arrived at the tomb, the bones are washed three times in a dish (this is a Cherra custom). In Mawshai, the bones are exposed to the heat of a fire kindled on a small jingthang, or burning-platform. The stone door of the cinerarium is then opened, and the bones of the females are placed in an earthen pot inside the tomb close to the wall which is farthest away from the door, the bones of the males being deposited in a pot inside the tomb nearest the door. Some clans keep the pot containing the bones of the males on the right, and the vessel containing those of the females on the left hand. Then offerings of food and libations of liquor are offered to the ancestors on a stone in front of the tomb. The males then perform a ceremonial dance with swords and shields, three times, and the door of the sepulchre is closed, a flag being fixed to the tomb. All the clansfolk then depart except three men."
290,"Tanding, or fire-test ceremony. One of the three men remaining from ceremony of placing the bones in the tomb of the clan (above) sacrifices a cock ( iar-tanding ) in front of the tomb, a second sits behind the sacrificer, holding three firebrands, and a third sits behind the tomb. The man with the firebrands shakes them about, and then crows like a cock three times. The man behind the tomb listens attentively for any fancied noise within it, the superstition being that if the ceremonies detailed above have not been properly performed, the whole tomb will quake. If the three watchers are satisfied that there is no commotion within the tomb, then all is well, and they return and report the result to the clanspeople."
291,"The Synteng Beh-dieng-khlam festival takes place annually at Jowai and elsewhere in the Jaintia Hills . Khlam is the Khasi word for plague or pestilence, and beh-dieng signifies to drive away with sticks. The festival may be described as follows:--The males rise betimes on the day fixed and beat the roof with sticks, calling upon the plague-demon to leave the house. Having done this, later on in the day they go down to the stream where the goddess “Aitan” dwells. Then poles of great length, which have been newly cut, are held across the stream. The people jump on the poles and try to break them; when they succeed in doing so, a great shout is given. After all these poles have been broken, a very large pole is fixed across the stream. The people then divide themselves into two parties, and contend for the possession of the tree. The contest, however, is a good-humored one, and although many buffets are given and received, these are not regarded seriously, and there are seldom any fights. The party which succeeds in obtaining possession of this post is supposed to gain health and prosperity during the coming year."
292,"Biannual Feast of the Dead, to placate the deceased. Opening address. Tobacco invocation. Songs. The dance. Announcement of feast and feasting. Social dances. Drumming for the distribution of goods. Having passed the climax of the ceremony, the crowd returns inside the longhouse to hear the Speaker wind up the ceremony until the spring celebration of the Dead Feast. This is a long speech and conforms to the customary pattern for such acknowledgments which terminate feasts and longhouse celebrations"
293,"The rite of confession, a part of most Midwinter gatherings, is usually held before the Festival itself begins. This rite includes a recitation of part of the Code of Handsome Lake by a “preacher” and public confessions by all who want to participate. A string of wampum lies on a bench. It is picked up and held by a person who confesses some violation of the Gaiwiio. It is then replaced. Ideally, this rite of confession is held before all rites addressed to the Creator"
294,"The False Face Ceremony combines personal curing, agricultural prophylaxis, and spirit supplication. The program at Sour Springs Longhouse begins with the Thanksgiving Address, after which there usually is an anxious, hushed waiting period, while the maskers finish dressing in the cookhouse. Suddenly the door opens, and a Husk Face (male or female) runs through the house, entering at the women's door and exiting at the men's. The Husk Faces are dumb, but they never keep still, and consequently they “wiggle” as they rush through “the house.” After an appropriate pause, the gutteral whinnies of the False Face language will be heard outside the women's door, and the unmasked leader of the False Face group pushes open the door with his hickory staff and sings the entering song of the False Faces. The masked False Faces, always males, covered over with burlap sacking and carrying large turtle rattles, roll and tumble into the house over the sill of the women's door, go around the house counterclockwise, and lie down beside the men's stove. A considerable amount of clowning, gesticulating, rattle shaking, grunting, ash rubbing, and handling of hot coals from the stove precedes the settling down of the “Faces.” Tobacco offering is made to the False Faces. At the end of the invocation a pinch of tobacco is handed to each of the maskers. They smell it, blow it as in curings, rub it between their hands, place some in their pipes if they happen to be carrying them, snuff it, and throw it into the stove. Two men then take their seats in the center of the house and play the four False Face tunes, to which the False Faces execute their characteristic dance. . The False Faces now rush around the inside of the house counterclockwise, chasing all the participants off their seats, touching and rubbing the benches, appurtenances, corners, and floor with their rattles, for this symbolizes the “chasing of the disease.” In their act of purification the False Faces may take liberties--jostling the girls, poking the matrons, uttering False Face cries close to the more nervous of the congregation, and in general “making an impression” on the population. The “proper” attitude toward False Faces in the Longhouse is to be frightened, and even if one is not actually frightened, one must pretend to be afraid and mention that one finds the False Faces fierce looking and “scary.” The entire membership is forced to participate in the round dance around the two stoves, which consists merely of walking around the two stoves in single file, men preceding women, in a counterclockwise direction. Then the False Faces run out. Finally, the communal food is distributed--False Face (roasted-white-corn) mush, cookies, scones, corn bread, bread."
295,
296,"Funeral. On the morning of the funeral the corpse is provided with a “lunch” consisting of corn bread 2 inches in diameter, which has been baked in ashes (“the dead people's way”). At Sour Springs the body is carried in and out of the longhouse through the women's door, while at Lower Cayuga and Seneca the east door is used for the entrance and the west for the exit. In all cases the foot end of the coffin is carried in first to simulate “walking” into the Longhouse, as if the person were “still with us.” The coffin is opened and placed in the center of the house on the singers' benches, the head westward and the feet eastward. Seating for a funeral is according to sex. A second condolence address is given by the speaker who had consoled the bereaved at home earlier. He says that perhaps some relatives had not heard the words expressed at the house, and therefore he condoles them again. Furthermore, he condoles the entire moiety of the bereaved, specifying as usual each of the ranks in the hierarchy. Then, the moiety of the deceased replies briefly in kind, avowing that the loss undoubtedly affected not them alone but also the condoling side. The speaker then announces that the people may now have a last look at the departed relative. All the speeches are phrased in such a way as to indicate that the deceased is still among the people, passing through the Longhouse a final time on his way to heaven. Going up to the coffin for a last look is considered extremely important, and orthodox members insist that the body must be brought into the Longhouse and must be visible. At Sour Springs the women circle the coffin counterclockwise first, followed by the men, and then followed by the family of the deceased, which is not separated by sex. After all have circled, the speaker announces that the coffin will be closed and the remains laid to rest. The coffin is carried out feet first, again as if the deceased were walking. Mourners then follow the coffin to the burial ground of the Longhouse, where the speaker delivers the last address. He indicates that now the departed has arrived at the final resting place and henceforth will be entrusted to the Creator. The mourners have done their duty as decreed by the Creator, and they should now release their hands from the dead. The coffin is lowered, again with the head to the west, and two shovels of earth are symbolically placed on the lowered coffin by a member of the moiety opposite to that of the deceased. Sometimes a single wreath from the family is added, and the mourners depart"
297,"The tenth-day feast formalizes the conclusion of the period of deep mourning and marks the final departure of the dead from the earth. In the Sour Springs community the visitors are first given a meal “on the table,” which means that each person sits at the table for a complete meal of corn soup and any other foods the family may be able to afford. As soon as a person has finished eating, he rises and takes his seat somewhere else in the room, and his place is filled, at the instruction of one of the cooks, by another visitor. There is very little, if any, conversation during the feasting, and all participants are reverent and solemn. Throughout the meal a place has also been set for the deceased and provided with a normal portion of food, which is kept until the next morning, when it is either given away or disposed of. The extra place setting for the deceased constitutes “feeding the dead,” and it is the crucial trait of the “feasting-the-dead” pattern. The dead are always described as “being hungry,” and keeping the food overnight gives them a good chance to absorb the essence of the nourishments. To symbolize the reintegration of the mourner into society, this matrilineal relative “cleans up” the spouse by combing his hair with a new comb and by presenting him with the means to reappear among humans. Since he has symbolically been said to have rent his clothing, he is given material for a garment (enough cotton print for a dress for a woman and white shirting for a shirt for a man), a silk scarf, a handkerchief, and the comb with which he was combed. The distribution of the personal effects of the deceased now follows. The speaker kneels near the pile of articles, and he begins to recapitulate chronologically the last days and death of the deceased. At each of these patterned speeches the matron hands the preassigned item to the speaker, who holds it in his hand during the announcement and then returns it to the matron, who hands it to the recipient. When the goods of the deceased have been distributed, the family “feasts” the dead again, and the cooks and helpers pass feast foods to all the guests."
298,"The most common of all personal observances at Six Nations is the “small dead feast” (niwa a tihakosrah). It is observed, like all dead feasts, only when the plants are not growing, since the summoning of the dead can bring with it a killing frost. During the winter these ceremonies occur several times a week. They are popular because they fulfill a multitude of obligations, give the dead the attention they so voraciously desire, and are simple--requiring only a speaker and some tobacco in addition to the food. Usually relatives from both sides of the family are invited since all may participate in feasting an ancestor. There are other feasts for the dead, including one for dead children."
299,"Six Nations Convention. Each year near the end of September, Tonawanda sends invitations to the other Longhouses to attend the initial Six Nations meeting. Although all members of the invited Longhouses are welcome, the custom is now to send just a representative to Tonawanda. The Longhouses are scheduled so that each sponsors a Six Nations every other year. There is at present a movement to change it to once every four years, due to the expense entailed and the burden placed on smaller Longhouses. All of its Longhouse members attend and sit on the south side, while the representatives of other Longhouses sit on the north. The invitation wampums are ceremonially returned by the representatives. They also make a monetary contribution to the convention and answer whether their Longhouse will accept being a part of the circuit for that year. Details as to coordination of dates are informally worked out during the convention. Following an introduction and thanks for attendance, the Thanks-giving address is made. The firekeepers circle the house counter-clockwise (the traditional custom of all Longhouse movements except the Dead Feast) shaking hands and greeting the visitors. The firekeepers then announce that they have a few things to say. A formal address is given, recalling the life and teachings of the Prophet and how the Longhouse Religion came into being. Since the beginning of the Religion, the central fire of the Longhouses of the Six Nations has been burning at Tonawanda. As Shimony notes, “Every year, when ready, one pokes it and renews it, and every year the teachings of Handsome Lake are preached. All the Longhouses around must come and renew what they know of Handsome Lake's teaching. This way Handsome Lake's teachings will never go down as long as people still believe. The remaining days are taken up with the recitation of the Code, confessions, business meetings and in the evenings, social dances. The different representatives give reports on how many attend the major ceremonies and what activities were held over the past year. Thanks is given by the fire-keeper that the Longhouse Religion is strong and that the people still think of the Great Creator. The convention ends with the Thanksgiving Address. Attendance at the convention by local people and the representatives is also stimulated by the desire to see the wampum that contains the mnemonics concerning the teachings of Handsome Lake: the hierarchy of chiefs, faith-keepers and people; the events occurring after the death of Handsome Lake; the correct behavior of the people, and predictions of the future. Part of the predictions includes the warning that a sign of the end times will be the waning of Longhouse devotion. Hence, the message is clear: if the end of the world is not to be hastened, then the Longhouse must be strong."
300,"Funeral. Site of grave is divined, corpse is tied with knees to chest and then sewn up in a white sheet. While the men were thus busy with the corpse, the mother and the grandmother who were sitting nearby began to intone a slow dirge, a long-drawn wailing song without words. Officiant scatters leaves at the bottom of the grave and then attempts to lift the corpse with a rope looped round it. He acts as if the corpse is very heavy, he repeats this attempted lifting nine times, each time it appears the corpse gets lighter. On the ninth attempt he appears to lift it with no effort. . After throwing a few coca leaves into it he directed the father to place the corpse in the pit, lying on its left side and with the head toward the east. The father now went to the underbrush and soon returned with an armload of green fern leaves which he spread carefully over the corpse. The officiant now ordered the men to fill the pit with earth, but when it was half full he interrupted them in their work and took from his bag five small bundles the contents of which he placed in the pit at the four cardinal points. There were some very small stones, some seeds, and some white cotton. The contents of the fifth bundle he placed in the middle of the pit, directly on top of the corpse. During the entire process of filling in the grave care had been taken not to bury the rope which was tied to the dead woman’s hair, and the máma often reminded the men not to lose sight of it and to keep it taut. When finally the pit was completely filled in the máma (officiant) asked one of the men to bring a thin rod, about 80 cm. long. The father now tied the free end of the rope to this stick which he pushedvertically into the soft soil while twisting the remaining rope loosely around it. The máma now called the parents of the dead woman and asked them to stand in front of him, at the western side of the grave. He said to them: “Turn around completely to the left.” The two did as told. “Now turn around completely to the right,” he continued. The two turned rapidly and the máma said: “Now go away while turning left.” The couple began to descend the slope, turning and turning until, after a while, they continued to walk toward the village. Then the others passed before the máma, turning first to the left, then to the right. “Get going, get going!” the máma said. When all had left he walked back to the grave and stood facing toward the east. Very slowly he turned to the right and then, three times, to the left."
301,"The gaulí ceremony; baptism, aims to pacify bad ancestral influences. Officiant sings songs to dieties, to inform them of childs name. The Máma (officiant) takes piece after piece of food, from a special bag, between his fingers and with the food touches the baby’s forehead, chest, fingers, knees, and feet. At the same time he intones a song. During the entire gaulí ceremony, the Máma “works,” of course, in every phase, first with his left hand and to the “left side,” and then with his right hand and to the “right side.” It is said that during the first two days the ceremonial is performed only “to take out the bad,” and then for two days “to bring the good.” On the last day the Máma places bindings of cotton thread on the baby’s wrists by means of which he transmits “strength” ( káma ) to him and protects him against illness."
302,"Initiation. Officiant intones a song to the Mother and then puts into the mouth of the youth four coca leaves. When the boy has chewed these leaves, the Máma takes them out of his mouth again and gives him four others, and thus four times. Then the Máma takes out of his bag a little gourd of lime and a little stick of wood, both manufactured by the boy and handed over to the Máma the day before. The little gourd does not yet have an opening, and the Máma hands him the two objects and says: “Now I give you the little gourd! Now I give you woman! Since you are now a man, I now give you a woman!” Then the Máma explains to the boy the symbolism of the little gourd. It represents a woman, or more properly the female sexual organ. The little stick of wood is the penis. To introduce the stick into the gourd represents coitus: Then the Máma orders the youth to pierce the gourd with the stick and indicates to him that this act represents defloration. The boy pushes the stick against one end of the vessel and thus produces a round opening. Then he passes the stick four times around the opening; then the gourd is his. Then the Máma hands over to the youth a little gourd with tobacco juice and shows him the place nearby where he should make the “house of the little gourd” (hú-tsukve, súgi-hubé) . This is a small house, the exact replica of a ceremonial house, but scarcely a meter and a half high and the same in diameter. While the Máma is showing him the place and explaining its construction to him, he talks to him about the future sexual relations between man and woman. Then he gives him “advice”: “You must not mistreat the woman! You must not have bad principles. You must not speak with four tongues!”. At the end the Máma orders the youth to begin the construction of the little house on the following day, and, in fact, he finishes this job after several hours. Now the Máma asks the boy for the little gourd and he places it inside the building. There it is “pledged.” The Máma then calls an old woman, generally a widow 50 to 60 years old. The youth must cohabit with her inside the little house in order to “pay” for the little gourd and get it back. Men remember this experience with horror. After the ceremonial coitus with the old woman, the youth takes his little gourd and keeps it. This object is not used, but rather is preserved as something sacred, and to replace it the youth can now obtain another one for his daily use. The secretions from the sexual organs should be gathered up in a piece of cotton to be handed over to the Máma, who then offers them as “food” to Heiséi. With this act the boy is regarded as definitively accepted in the circles of the men, is counted as an adult, and possesses, in the form of the little gourd, a sewá of extraordinary value inasmuch as it assures him of a woman in the Beyond"
303,"Annual ceremonies of the dances of the masks. Once the day for the beginning of the ceremony has been determined by divination, the whole town is cleaned, and the road which leads from it to the nearby stream or river, where those attending will take their ritual baths, is repaired. Then the Máma lights a fire in the ceremonial house by means of a drill. In the meantime the fire is extinguished in all of the houses and is then lighted again with embers which each man brings from the ceremonial house to his dwelling. In the afternoon the Máma and his assistants, as well as the men of status who will take an active part in the dance, leave the town and go to a nearby house, to the one belonging to the Máma or to one belonging to some Elder, where the masks and other ritual objects have been deposited beforehand. There they put on the costumes, ornaments, and masks, and at nightfall they come back to the town. Some men play large gourd trumpets announcing the arrival of the masks, but otherwise the participants proceed silently in single file. Upon arriving in the town, they then pass through its plaza and all enter the ceremonial house, walking first toward the east, then toward the west, south, and north, respectively, all with short steps, the knees bent, and making bows toward the “four corners of the world.” Meanwhile only the trumpets are played. This entrance of the masks is interpreted as a ceremonial greeting. Halting in the middle of the house, the masks pronounce the ritual greetings and commence a song accompanied by a slow dance, during which the dancers scarcely move from their places, but only rock the body from side to side or abruptly move the head from side to side. In the accompanying song the masks say that they were sent by the Universal Mother to visit the Kogi and to see if “all is in accord.” They ask if there are food and firewood, if all have confessed and fasted, and if the town has been cleaned. After a short time the participants remove the masks and place them on large tripods of stakes, which have been placed along the walls in the interior of the ceremonial house for this purpose. Then the gathering sits down on little benches and hammocks, and periods of conversation, singing and dancing performed by individuals and more of the nature of practicing, follow. Occasionally the Máma intervenes and directs the dancing, inviting all of the men to participate in it. They go on dancing this way through the night, sometimes with the masks, sometimes without them. Now maracas, trumpets, drums, and flutes accompany the songs, and the dancers stop facing in this direction, perhaps just turning their faces and maracas to this side. Thus “the masks speak with the directions” and “keep the bad at a distance and bring the good.” At the same time the Máma receives from the men, dancers or observers, the bundles of mineral dust, opens them, and blows their contents toward the four directions. Many times the men themselves do this and the Máma does not personally intervene. According to the time of year or the special object of the ceremony, they next repeat certain dances and songs, say, the dance of Kandjí, the dance of Namsíku, the dance of the rain, or the many dances which are performed in order to “be in accord” with the animals which damage the crops. In the festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, the next day is devoted to the dance of the mask of Surlí or the one of Nuikukúi (the Master of the East). At dawn the tripods with the masks are placed outside the ceremonial house with the faces turned toward the east “to greet the sun.” In the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, the mask of Surlí dances outside or inside the ceremonial house, his dance being accompanied by songs and the sound of the trumpets. At night the masks are brought in again, and the dances and songs continue until dawn, together with the offerings of mineral powder. In the free hours, however, the men devote themselves to small household tasks, eat from time to time, or toast coca leaves in the ceremonial house. No matter what the immediate object of the ceremony may be, whether “to turn the sun around” or “to arrange a rain-shower” (that is to say, to make it rain), the prime concern is always to keep sicknesses away. In the songs they speak of “making fences on the roads of sickness” or of “closing the doors to sickness,” and on occasion the dancers manipulate a small broom of leaves in each hand for the purpose of “sweeping away sickness” and “cleaning the pueblo.”"
304,"The first planting of the year, or in general the first planting in a new field, is always the occasion for a ceremony. After confession, divination, and delivery of the appropriate sewá, the Máma, together with the owner of the new planting, goes to the field, where before dawn he deposits upon a flat stone the seeds which it is intended to plant. When the sun comes up and the first rays fall on the seeds, these are regarded as fertilized, and it is thought that at this moment the sun cohabits with the seeds. Then these can be mixed with other seeds of the same plant, which, although not “fertilized” by the sun, now acquire this property. First of all, the seeds of maize and frijoles are “baptized,” because they are “children.”"
305,"The first harvest is celebrated in the following manner: the owner of the crop first gathers from each plant a single fruit and in addition picks up from the ground at the foot of each plant “black, white, red, and blue earth.” He delivers these objects to the Máma, whose wife pulverizes the earth and wraps it in a maize leaf in the form of an offering, which is then deposited by the Máma in the sacred place. At the same time the latter sings to the Universal Mother or to the Mothers of the Yuca, Frijol, Maize, or whatever plant it may be, and expresses the satisfaction of the owner for the good harvest, but he also adds that the latter is afraid that “the food may harm him.” On the morning of the following day the wife of the Máma cooks the fruits which the man has brought and both the latter and the Máma eat them, after which he may continue harvesting. The concern that “the food may do harm” is always present in the ceremonies, and many times offerings are made for the sole purpose of avoiding this possible “harm,” which is explained by the Kogi as the danger of ailments of the digestive tract. During the harvest ceremony itself, when it is a matter of frijoles, maize, coca, or tobacco, some seeds are always kept to be used at the first planting period of the following year."
306,
307,"Birth ceremony. Really just a feast. The greater the number of guests and the greater the amount of food distributed, the greater the prestige of the happy father. Since his political importance will persist and his lavish spending on his guests will be reciprocated, the birth ceremony may be regarded as a profitable economic enterprise."
308,"First hair-cutting ceremony the child is not subjected to any ceremonial treatment until he reaches puberty. The first hair-cutting ceremony is performed by the father who cuts the hair and shaves the child’s head with a bamboo knife. After this task is completed, and the hair hidden in the bush to protect the child against possible sorcery, the proud father gives a feast to his relatives and friends by treating them to steamed pork. The ceremony has no magical connotation; it celebrates the child’s growth and health and provides the father with an opportunity to prove his generosity"
309,"Girls initiation. Her father, brother, parallel cousin, or (if she is married) her husband builds her daba owa, “a menstruation hut.” This simple structure consists of an oblong frame of sticks, leaned against two posts, and thatched over with grass and branches. The girl is expected to stay in the hut for two nights and two days during her first two menstruations. In the hut she is kept company by two or three older women who may be her mother, older sisters, brothers’ wives, mother’s sisters, or father’s sisters. During this time the girl is instructed by her custodians in marital duties, birth, child care, and in the observance of taboos connected with menstruation and womanhood. These taboos are of two categories: one is connected exclusively with the puberty ceremony, the other consists of food taboos which the girl, now considered an adult woman, will have to observe until the beginning of her menopause. Accordingly, during her first two menstruations she is forbidden to sleep, listen to legends, and leave the hut. Should she violate these taboos her punishment will be supernatural: if she sleeps she will suffer from nightmares; if she listens to legends she will have to bear the early death of her husband; if she leaves the hut, she will suffer a great illness. Sickness will also result, it is believed, from her eating any kind of wild game, banana, sugar cane, native beans, manioc, and certain kinds of caterpillars. The strictest supernatural sanction-that of inevitable death-is attached to the taboo, which prohibits the menstruating girl from washing herself or combing her hair. At the close of the ceremonial seclusion the girl is expected to hide the leaves into which she collected her menstrual blood in order to prevent a sorcerer from harming her by the use of contagious magic. At this time she also exchanges her loose girl skirt for an adult woman’s loin wrap."
310,"Ceremonial collection of bride price, nearest thing to a wedding ritual. This happens in two parts, the first is informal, it is called the one , the second is called kade makii naago (lit.: “the day when kade is laid down”). On this same day the already gathered one is publicly displayed on pandanus rain mats, and is later formally surrendered to the bride’s relatives. The kade makii naago starts begins on the stated day at approximately ten o’clock in the morning when the father, brother, or mother of the groom places one or two rain mats in front of their house. Often the one, is laid on the mat for public inspection. Early in the morning people begin to arrive from all directions in order to act either as contributors or simply as spectators to the ceremony. The bride’s relatives usually arrive all in one group. At the gathering they usually keep together, squatting in one group near the mats with the bride wealth. Frequently the amount of shell displayed fails to meet their expectations, and one can immediately guess their displeasure from their somber expressions. At this time the contributors come forward to deposit their shell, beads, or necklaces on the mats. Since the expression on the faces of the members of the bride’s party remain stern, the local headmen begin to worry about trouble which may arise any time. They remind them that if the expectations of the bride’s party are not fully satisfied, the young man faces a possible loss of his bride. In order to make their appeal more dramatic, the headmen may start wainai, “a mad dance,” by stamping the ground with their feet and holding their left arms outstretched and the right arms bent at the elbow, as if they were ready to discharge imaginary arrows. While stamping furiously in a fast rhythm, they yell and scream their requests to the gathered audience. In their endeavor to increase the contributions the headmen are not alone. At some point the father, brothers, or paternal uncles of the bride join in the tumult with reproaches and insults hurled, not so much at the already insolvent groom and his close paternal relatives, as at their more distant kin and friends, trying to make them feel ashamed of their lack of generosity. If these performances fail to elicit the desired effect, the men of the bride’s party are forced into the mad dance themselves, thus posing a real threat of breaking up the negotiations. The atmosphere is filled with emotions, threats, danger, and especially with a grave challenge to the reputation of the friends and kin of the groom. No matter what they think about the adequacy of the already assembled bride wealth, they may find themselves reaching into the corners of their netted purses and pulling out additional precious shell and necklaces. As if in a trance they move to the mat, squat, and surrender their treasures to the displayed bride price, perhaps to regret their generous deeds later, when they have cooled off. As more and more individuals experience this ecstatic generosity, the loud appeals and voices of the headmen and the bride’s relatives soften, and their angry looks are finally replaced by very faint smiles of satisfaction. Their pleasure over the collected bride price is not, however, made explicit. The Kapauku are never supposed to show too openly their enjoyment over a business deal because one can never tell whether the other party might not make an even more attractive offer. The groom, now assured of the success of his wedding, dries his tear-stained eyes and presents his new in-laws with the promised one or two pigs. The whole ceremony is concluded by approximately three in the afternoon."
311,"Prior to burial, the hearth in the house of the deceased is beaten with a stick. Close kin weep, tear clothes, eat ashes, cut off their fingers. and smear their faces and bodies with mud, ashes, or yellow clay. The most conspicuous manifestation of grief is a loud sing-song lamentation that is called jii jii tai . In order to give more publicity to his sorrow a bereaved mourner climbs a hill or a cliff where he laments and weeps as loudly as his vocal cords will allow. His jii jii tai is carried by the winds through the valley, announcing the sad news to all the relatives and friends in remote villages. Obedient to the message, the relatives smear their faces or even their bodies with clay, mud, or ashes. They hurry to the place of death and rush into the house of the deceased; wailing loudly, they beat the hearth in the men’s dormitory with a long stick. They believe that in so doing they punish the spirit of hearth, who dwells underneath the stone fireplace, and is believed to consume the body in the grave."
312,"Prior to the juwo, “the pig feast” , this ritual occurs, it marks the beginning of the building of the dance house for the feast. After the building material has been gathered together, the main sponsor initiates the building of the dance house by a magical rite which is supposed to assure the success of the feast and bring lots of money to its sponsors. Early in the morning on the taka wei naago, the day when the people start building the dance house (lit.: “the day when the forked sticks of the foundation of the dance house are stuck into the ground”) the main sponsor goes to the forest where he cuts a tall onage, “a willowlike tree.” Over the stump of this freshly cut tree he prays to the Creator to grant success to the feast and bring lots of cowrie shell to the sponsors. After this prayer (which has a definitely magical significance) is concluded, the performer sacrifices the intestines of a rat by placing them on the stump. Then the sponsor with his aides, shouting and yelling for joy, run with the cut onage tree to the building site. There they plant it, together with a ti plant, into the ground next to the place where the main front post that is to carry the ridgepole will be erected. Next to the planted onage tree a hole is dug into which rat intestines are deposited, the action being properly accompanied by a magical spell. The hole is then closed by driving into it a single end of a forked stick that will be the first support for the frame of the spring floor of the dance house."
313,"The juwo, “the pig feast”, the sponsors slaughter about eight pigs and distribute small pieces of pork to the multitude. Groups of people, representing a village, lineage, sublineage, or even a confederacy, arrive from all directions, running, yodeling, and jumping over the deep mud holes and ditches filled with rain water. Upon their arrival each group performs the familiar waita tai, the counterclockwise circular dance, which they follow with tuupe . This is a treading dance accompanied by a repetitious song, during which the whole group of people, who are pressed against each other, tread clockwise. Then the people rush into the dance house to jump on the spring floor and to sing an ugaa song. This performance starts with barking cheers, while the people, standing on one place, bend their knees in a fast rhythm and make the spring floor go up and down. After a few minutes the singing subsides and an individual begins a solo song that, after a sentence or two, becomes a duet in which a “helper” answers the singer in counterpoint fashion. This duet, lasting only two to three minutes, is followed by a chorus in which the whole group participates. At about nine o’clock in the morning pieces of raw meat are distributed to the male visitors. Afterward, cooking mounds are made in which the entrails of the slaughtered pigs are steamed. Thus prepared, the entrails are cut into small pieces by the sponsors or their close relatives, and distributed to the women and children. In the afternoon the feast is concluded by a conference held by the sponsors of the feast who, aided by experienced and influential advisors, decide upon the time of the final and main feast, which is called juwo degii naago"
314,"Tapa, fund-raising ceremony, which is undertaken by a sponsor and cosponsors seeking to raise money for a specific economic purpose, such as raising money for a bride price or blood reward payment. No special structure is erected for this ritual. The tapa ceremony takes place in the village of the sponsor and lasts only one day. It resembles a pig feast in that people come in groups, perform the waita tai and tuupe dances, bring their pigs for slaughter and for sale, and trade their manufactured items for shell money. Unlike the pig feast, the focus of this event is the collecting activity of the sponsors of the tapa . They make long speeches in which they exhort their relatives and friends to contribute to the funds they are soliciting. Sometimes they even perform odija ugaa, a dance consisting of tiny jumps with bent knees and with legs held together. This performance is accompanied by a song in which the potential contributors are asked to be generous. It is especially the cross-cousins, the in-law and maternal relatives, and the friends of the sponsors who grant the most extensive loans; in order to exhibit their generosity they bring their contributions, especially those to the dabe uwo, in a procession in which the shell and beads, strung on long inner-bark strings, are carried suspended from long forked sticks. Upon arrival each group of contributors approaches the sponsors at a treading pace. Very often a woman, who treads backward while facing the carriers of the money, heads the group. The procession ends by a waita tai dance, after which the contribution is ceremonially surrendered to the sponsors. In order to make the fund-raising ceremony more attractive the sponsor, and sometimes also the cosponsors, may kill one or several pigs and distribute some of the meat as gifts. The gifts of meat are offered especially to those individuals who come to the ceremony to repay a loan or to grant a new one to one of the sponsors. The fund-collecting ceremony is concluded late in the afternoon when most of the contributors and traders return home in small groups; a few others remain in the village overnight to enjoy freshly steamed pork and friendly conversation."
315,"Healing ritual. Every magical procedure that I have observed started with a prayer by the shaman to the sun and moon Creator and to the shaman’s guardian spirits. During the performance that follows, a shaman invariably uses a magically powerful plant. Its selection often depends on the diagnosis of the cause of the disease. As a rule the evil spirits are associated with particular plants. However, the most generally used plant, often utilized next to that which a particular spirit requires, is the green variety of the ti plant. Its stem, with a few leaves left at its end, is a repellent of most of the evil spirits. The shaman carries it around his patient, touches the head and other parts of the body with it, shakes it furiously, and thus expels the spirit that causes the disease. Very often the plants are used together with glowing embers. The whole bundle, consisting of both ingredients, is moved counterclockwise, followed immediately by clockwise circles, around the patient’s head. This performance is almost always accompanied by involved, repetitive spells, uttered rapidly by the shaman, and by his spitting on the embers as well as around the patient. Since water is believed to have a purifying force the shaman and the sick man apply it freely to different parts of their bodies. The spirits are almost always bribed by the plants and glowing embers —augmented by sacrificial small birds, rats, or intestines of some larger animals—into leaving the body of the patient. Toward the end of the rite these offerings are hung on a pole, or thrown behind the shaman into the bush. The procedure may be combined with performances during which a shaman extracts, by sleight of hand, an evil object from the patient’s body."
316,"Besudi, healing ritual. Ritual occurs at night time. The family of the sick child prepares a lizard out of rice and puts the basket covered with a man's sarong into a corner of the bilek. Manang Jabing takes a seat in the bilek and looks through a quartz-crystal (batu-ilau) into the flame of an oil lamp. By doing this he is able to find the soul of the child. Covered with an ikat (pua kumbu) he sings a himself into trance and travels with the “rice-lizard” into the world of the antus (ghosts). As the ghost arrive the “rice-lizard” confuses them and enables the manang to catch the soul. The “rice-lizard” has to be killed now to prevent the ghosts from coming to the longhouse. The manang hits the “animal” on its head. Awakening from trance he shows a little stone (as visible sign of the soul) and places it on the crown of the head of the sick child"
317,"Pelians, healing ritual. A “Pagar Api,” which is a long handled spear fixed blade upwards in the middle of the verandah with a few leaves of some sort tied round it, and having at its base the “lupongs” (object of magical virtue - boar tusk, stone etc) of each Manang. Then the leader begins a long monotonous drawl at the rate of about two words a minute, which, however, increases in velocity as the performance proceeds; the rest either chanting with him, or joining in at choruses, or may be singing antiphonally with him, all squatting on the floor. After a tiresome period of this dull drawling, they stand up, and march with slow and solemn step round the ‘Pagar Api,” the monotonous chant slackening or quickening as they march the whole night through with only one interval for a feed in the middle of the night. The patient simply lies on his mats and listens. Then they “bark at the sickness,” in other words, call upon it to be off to the ends of the earth, and to return to the regions of the unseen world: they invoke the aid of spirits, and of ancient worthies and unworthies down to their own immediate ancestors, and spin the invocations out to a sufficient length to bring them to the daylight hours. Here the grand climax is reached-the truant soul has to be caught. The Manangs rush round the “Pagar Api” as hard as they can, singing until one of them falls on the floor and remains motionless; the others sit down. The bystanders cover the motionless Manang with a blanket, and wait whilst his spirit is supposed to hie away to Hades, or wherever the erring soul has been carried, and to bring it back. Presently he revives, looks vacantly about like a man just waking out of sleep, then he rises with his right hand clenched as if holding something. That hand contains the soul; and the Manang proceeds to the patient, and returns it to the body through the crown of the head, muttering at the same time a few words of incantation. This “nangkap semengat,” “catching the soul,” is the great end. As the devouring demon is supposed to be driven away by the magical arts and charms of the Manang, so the soul is allured into submission to him by his persuasive invitations and melodious cadences. An invocation of good dreams ends the ceremony, and is supposed to complete the cure"
318,"Mandi rumah literally translated is ‘to bathe the house.’ Occurs when new people move to a house. The opening ceremony is miring ka tangga , (the offering to the ladder). As soon as the new ladder is placed in position, Pulang Gana and other gods are propitiated by an offering, which is hung underneath the ladder, and the sacrifice of a pig. An old man then recites. The second ceremony is mangkong tiang. The same old man enters the room of the chief of the house first to perform the rite. Another offering is prepared in the room, and is placed on the shelf of the kitchen for Pulang Gana, the god of the earth. The chanter must repeat the ceremony in every room, and if the house be a long one, a great part of the day will have slipped by ere the drowsy old man, now an object of mirth and laughter, has finished his task. In the ruai or reception room of the house the professional reciters are deeply engaged with their incantation called pengap to look for igi engkuni. It is a long recitation (and is done at the top of their voices) to implore the father of Nendak to descend from above or the father of Nendak. The incantation begins from four in the afternoon and goes on till daylight the next day. The feast lasts a day and a night and the house or village is generally quite full. The confusion and the noise are great. At the approach of day light much stir is made, when Apai Nendak, Pulang Gana, and the rest of the gods are supposed to arrive at the feast. Offerings are made to them and the musical instruments are struck louder and with more vigor. There is shouting and laughter, the crowing of cocks and dogs fighting."
319,"When a person dies a professional wailer is engaged either immediately or two or three days after the death occurs. This is called the rite of nyabak nerengka , which means lamenting the deceased in order that he may travel direct to Hades. It appears that, with the Dyaks, unless the ceremony of nyabak nerengka is performed the soul of the dead wanders about in the unseen world and will never reach Hades. The professional wailer is generally a gifted person, skilled in poetry, and is supposed to possess an intimate knowledge of all that befalls the dead on their journey to Hades through the unseen regions. He avers that the soul has to pass seven places of the utmost importance before it reaches it's destination. Therefore unless the sabak nerengka is properly performed the soul will never reach Hades and will encounter the greatest danger. He avers also that while giving the should assistance he is himself treading on dangerous soil, and therefore demands a large fee for steering the soul of the departed into it's haven of everlasting bliss. The proceeding in nyabak nerengka is considered to be a complete sacrifice to the powers reigning in Hades. The wailer sits on a swing in the room of the deceased, and her opening words are couched in the choicest poetry which charms and fascinates her hearers who delight in such fictions. She commences by severely blaming all the materials of the building for not holding back the soul of the deceased. This undoubtedly points to the fact that the Dyaks regard such inanimate objects as gods. She then traces the journey of the soul in it's six perilous positions. Firstly, towards the country of the Tigers; secondly, towards the Kayu malam ; thirdly, towards the abode of the bird Dundun ; fourthly, towards the haunt of the bird Undan ; fifthly, towards the country of the Great Wind; and sixthly, towards Hades, and when it arrives it throws itself down as one who has endured great fatigue. As the soul is in that unconscious state through the fatigue of it's incessant journey Dara Rambai Geruda Salabong Kanggam brings it refreshment and through her magic revives it, and enables it to partake of it with a good appetite."
320,"Ngambi Sabayan ngabang”, or to invite the Spirits at Hades to the feast, expresses the object of the feast called “Berantu.” A professional wailer is engaged to perform a lengthy recitation in the nature of an invocation to the powers of the unseen world, and to make a complete offering to them. The feast to the dead lasts a day and a night. In the morning the wailer begins the recitation which is called “ Sabak bebuah ” in the room of the bereaved persons. Whilst the women are attentively listening to the fascinating poetry of the wailer, which composition is sometimes heart-rending and sometimes soothing, the men are busily engaged in setting cocks to fight. Weeping, laughing, and shouting to such an extent, they create so great an uproar that it is almost too terrible to be a listener for any length of time. As soon as night falls, the wailer's swing is removed to the covered verandah of the house (ruai) , where continues the poetical recitation till the dawn of day. The sacrifice and the present (ma) to the deceased are also taken out to the ruai for exhibition and are hung on the wall of the passage or common thoroughfare of the house. Everybody is seated and order is kept for the space of about half an hour, in order that proper respect may be paid to the ceremony of muka ulit , or the unloosening of the mourning tie. A gong is struck at the head of a procession which is then formed to announce the freedom of the mourners from their sacred tie by those who have recently returned from a war expedition. The mourning robes are touched with the sharp blades of the warrior's sword and cast aside. Whilst this is going on war cries are shouted and deafening music from brass instruments creates an infernal din. A fowl is waved over the mourners' heads and killed, and the blood is smeared on their persons. Then and not until then is the sacred tie of mourning pronounced loosened. The wailer narrates his travelling in a high mountain. The result of this is to put the inhabitants of Hades, the afterlife into a state of alarm, they see the living making a feast and realize that it being meant for them. The next morning after the feast the offertory sacrifice is taken to the cemetery and is placed on the grave of the deceased."
321,"Gawai Batu , or the Feast of the Whetstones, held just before the clearing of the farm land commences. A blessing is asked upon the stones that they may make the implements sharp for cutting down jungle. The gods Pulang Gana, Ini Andan, and Manang Jaban are specially invoked in this feast. When all the guests have arrived and have seated themselves a live fowl is waved over their heads, and then the fowl is killed and the forehead of everybody is touched with the blood. The toddy is distributed. Quiet again reigns when food is served out. After everybody has eaten an elderly man is asked to make the sacrifice and the offering to the CPS . He takes his position on the platform ( tanju ) a wooden trough is put before him and in it the whetstones are put; above the whetstones a pig is placed and the man takes a spear and pierces the heart of the pig and the blood is made to run into the wooden trough to besmear the whetstones. After the sacrifice is over the man commences to make an offering of pinang, sireh , black pulut rice, and barley cooked in leaves, smoked fish, eggs, sweet cakes, and smoked keli . This offering is put into the wooden trough with the whetstones. The man then invokes Pulang Gana Raja Sua, Ini Andan , and Manang Jaban , beseeching them to look and behold and to turn their faces towards them; he requests them to listen to their petitions, protect them, and show favour to them. At dusk the men begin to intone the incantation invoking Pulang Gana to come to the feast. Every pandong in the house is gone round by the men who intone the incantation in the choicest words of their poetry. Between four and five o'clock in the morning Pulang Gana and his train are supposed to arrive at the house. The musical instruments are immediately struck and a procession is formed to give the party an honorable reception. An offering is brought and with it a live white fowl is waved about for the propitiation. The CPS, instills weaving proficiency in women and charms for producing paddy in men. At break of day Pulang Gana and his train return home. After their departure the guests also disperse to their homes."
322,"“Nyinklan Benih,” or The Ceremony of touching the paddi seeds with blood. To avoid incurring the displeasure of the gods and especially Pulang Gana it is considered necessary to ask his blessing upon them, the blood of a sacrificed pig must be smeared on them. The chief of the house or village, owing to his rank, occupies a prominent place on this occasion. His covered verandah ( ruai ) is decorated, a basket ( sintong ) is placed in the centre and in it an offering to Pulang Gana and Ini Andan is placed. Everybody in the village or house puts a handful of his seed into the sintong , and with it his paddy charms wrapped up in pieces of old cloth. The sintong is carefully covered with home-made blankets ( pua ). After dinner an able man is asked to intone a fable in the choicest words of their poetry to invoke the presence of Pulang Gana and Ini Andan at the feast which is given in their honor. The intoner also sings praises to the seed and personifies them. The whole night is spent in listening to the intoner. Before he introduces his mythological poetry a pig is first killed, and it's blood is smeared on the sintong in which the offering, seed and charms are put. At dawn the sintong is taken to the farm and is placed on a raised platform ( plasar ). An offering with flags is suspended on the platform and the mythologist begins the preliminary sowing round the platform so as to surround the sintong by making about thirty or forty holes, then his duty is completed. The seed cannot be touched by anybody before he has performed the preliminary sowing"
323,"The ceremony of first taking a child to bathe is called by the Dyaks mre anak mandi . An elderly man of a well-to-do, long respected family leads the procession with a flag. Behind him walks another aristocrat who brings a cock. After them walk a woman who carries the child in a beautifully woven blanket. Behind her another woman carries and sprinkles the letup (popped rice) along the road to the river. Behind her are the young men who perform gendang music. As the procession reaches the pengkalan , the man who carries the flag cuts the water with the prayers. After this prayer is ended a man who carries the cock kills it above the place where the child is to have his bath. As the cock's blood drips into the river, a woman baths the child in the river where the blood is drifting. Another woman throws coins and beads into the river. As soon as the child is dipped into the river, one of the bystanders fires his shotgun in the air to deafen them from hearing any omen and at the same time the musicians beat their gongs and drums. After the child has been bathed, the cock's wings are severed and hung from a barbed spear ( berayang ) thrust blade upward on the river bank, and the basket of offerings is hung from a bamboo. After the ceremony is over, the procession returns to the house with music of gongs and drums."
324,"The main purpose of gawai amat is, as we have indicated, to invite Lang and his extended family to a feast held in their honor. Festival proceedings are structured by the performance of an invocation, or timang (in some areas pengap ), which summons the gods to the gawai , and describes their journey from their celestial home to the longhouse of men. The timang is performed by professional bards - lemambang - who carry out their duties between dusk and dawn. Often the invocation lasts for several nights in succession, its length being determined by the type of gawai being celebrated. As we have mentioned, the ranyai palm, and its curious fruit, provide a central image, or ritual focal point, at gawai amat . On such occasions, this mythical tree is physically represented by a specially constructed “shrine”, which is erected in the ruai , or longhouse gallery, for the duration of the festival. The shrine is itself referred to by the term ranyai , and ideally should be assembled by someone who has taken a head, or who is renowned for his bravery in warfare. It consists of a framework of bamboo and rattan, reaching from the floor of the ruai to the rafters, wrapped around with a mat to create a vertical column some six or seven feet in circumference. Concealed in the center of this construction is a plate of offerings ( piring ) and a basket of charms and other items that are to be “blessed by the visit of the gods. The ranyai shrine is said to be the abode of the gods for the duration of the festival, and is circumambulated by the bards, or lemambang , in the course of their performance of the timang invocation. In this respect it provides a focal point for ritual activities during the gawai ."
325,"Gawai, festival. The ritual action at Iban gawai , or festivals, is based upon an oral narrative, or timang. Timang are performed by professional bards, or lemambang , assisted by a two-or three-man chorus ( orang nyagu ). All timang gawai amat follow the same general pattern, or “path” ( jalai ), but their length varies according to the grade of festival being celebrated. Each level takes the timang invocation a stage further in the narrative, with the highest grade of festival completing the cycle. The main body of the timang gawai amat, that is to say the part which is always performed at every gawai amat, can be broken up into a number of key episodes, or narrative sequences. These are as follows: the opening sequence, in which Lang Sengalang Burong's absence is noticed; the sending of an invitation to the house of Lang ( ngambi' ngabang ); the headhunting expedition of the gods ( ngerampas ); Lang's journey to the longhouse of men; and the ceremonial welcome of Lang on his arrival there ( mansang ngabang ). Only the highest ranking festivals in the gawai amat cycle see the timang performed all the way through. Lower level gawai pause at some earlier stage in the narriative - for example at the point describing the forging of farm implements, or when Lang sets out in search of land for his swiddens. To have completed the cycle is the greatest achievement that an individual can aspire to within the traditional Iban prestige system."
326,"the rites of manggol , which inaugurate the actual clearing of farm-land. No family, however, begins until it feels that it has the good will or blessing of the spirits--the state called lantang --and spirit approval is normally conveyed in a dream. Once assured that the spirits have approved the undertaking, and, in practice, this normally occurs at the distribution of kayu burong or a day later, the Iban go in family units to their farms to perform the manggol rites. On the way their ears are stopped ( besedal pending ) to avoid hearing other undesirable bird-calls. They take with them their kayu burong and all that is required for sacrifices and offerings. All bilek members participate, even children who cannot contribute actively, since it is thought that the fortune of one is the fortune of all. Both manggol and the rites which initiate harvest are matters for the bilek and must be attended by the man and his wife as well as their children if possible and other bilek members. On arriving at the farm site ( pangkalan ) the Iban selects a suitable tree. It must be latex- or sap-producing ( kayu begetah ), ideally pudu , or alternatively tekalong, lengkan , or the fruiting arak . With his left hand he scrapes away the weeds and undergrowth from a patch of ground close to the base of the chosen tree. He does this two or three times. Afterwards, in the same way, he does it with his right hand. Although in theory any member of the bilek family can do this, it is most commonly performed by the tuai bilek , who then places the kayu burong on the cleared patch and says a prayer. The left-side omen-sticks ( Nendak kiba , etc.) are placed in position at the foot of the chosen tree, which is considered especially suitable if it has buttresses ( bandir ). The right-hand omen-sticks ( Nendak kanan ) are fixed into the tree where a cut is made ( silit kayu ) at the height of rice grain when ripe ( tuntun buah padi ). At felling, this tree is left standing. After making a first symbolic slash, called mantap pangkalan , with his bush-knife ( duku ), the Iban places his ritual whetstones close to the ground. The whetstones themselves are carefully screened and sheltered ( dipantar ). Were they to be damaged, this would be a sign of serious misfortune, and in no case may they be disturbed by another Iban. After a piring sacrifice, which comprises the usual ingredients but must be topped by an egg, the Iban performs a biau ceremony. As he waves a fowl, which, in this instance, is specifically required to be female ( manok indu ), he calls on the spirits. After this he kills the hen and arranges the sacrifice in either two or three piring. One he places at ground level by the foot of the tree where the kayu burong are, a second one by the whetstones ( apa batu ), and for this he constructs a little shelter ( langkau ); the third one is set on a raised support ( tresang dipanggau ) at a height of five to six feet. If there are only two piring, one is placed at ground level and the other on a raised support. Wherever the piring , it is carefully fenced to forestall an ill omen: a snake, for example, passing over it ( mansa ular ) would imply poor yields for at least three years"
327,"Special rites are also associated with the path which leads from the longhouse to the area chosen for farming. Augury in the early morning initiates the proceedings and the birds sought are Nendak and, usually, Beragai and/or Embuas. The kayu burong are taken together with a piring , a pig and a fowl, to the point at which the new farm track leads from an earlier established path. Women beating gongs accompany the procession of longhouse members; as on other occasions, the gongs are intended to prevent further inauspicious omens being heard once the tokens of good omens are already in hand. Gong-beating ceases on arrival at the path intersection, and preparations for the sacrifice begin. The piring are arranged in three portions: one for the Nendak omens heard on the left, one for those heard on the right, and a third for the Embuas call. The seven Nendak calls on the left were, on this occasion, accorded a piring divided into two sets of seven each; the nine on the right received two sets of nine. The piring for Embuas was subdivided into one triple portion. Beragai was thought to be covered by the others and did not receive a separate piring. The fowl was used to biau and waved over the piring in the usual manner. Then the pig was killed and its liver inspected. An unsatisfactory liver would have been thought to imply a poor harvest, pests or sickness, and had the liver been poor, the tuai burong would have tried a second pig. After examining three livers and finding all inauspicious, the longhouse community might have decided to change the farm site (. On this occasion the liver proved satisfactory, and the carcass of the pig was buried beside the piring as an additional offering before the party returned home, once again to the accompaniment of gong-beating."
328,"When all families in the longhouse have completed the planting of their farms, the rite which terminates the planting prohibitions takes place. This is known as basoh arang . A little burnt wood, charcoal ( arang ), is taken from the farm and mixed with a few grains of rice which have been set aside while planting the padi pun . The tuai burong leads the proceedings, and, as soon as all families have prepared piring sacrifices (which may be anything from three to ninefold), he waves a fowl in the biau ceremony and says: We are here to wash charcoal Having completed the planting. Now may men spear, and may men shoot, Plait rottan handles, stop up holes, Kill creeping snakes, and cut down creepers, Clear and cut bark. Women may tie and weave kebat.... Death to grass-weeds, growth to rice, Rice flourish, grass-weeds perish! May there be plentiful rice for all the longhouse from one end to the other. He washes his own hands symbolically in a bowl of water which also contains the charcoal and rice seed. First he throws water against the wall that ‘the rice may be close and thick like the wall’ ( ngambi ka padi rapit baka dinding ), then against the posts of the longhouse that ‘the rice stems may grow to the size of a post’ ( ngambi ka pun padi besai tiang ). While his hands are still wet he should not touch his head lest the rice be small like the individual hairs ( takut ka padi mit rambar baka rambar bok ). After the tuai burong , other members of the longhouse wash their hands in the charcoal water."
329,"When the rice begins to ripen ( belaboh murai ) the ceremony of burning wax ( nunu lilin ) normally takes place. After a simple piring has been prepared and an omen-stick ( kayu burong ) has been suspended at the height of ripe ears of rice ( tuntun buah padi ), a small piece of wax is burned on top of the stump of a tree at the farm. This is accompanied by an invocation ( sampi ) and followed by further fivefold piring and a second wax burning. The invocation follows the usual pattern of wishing ill away, summoning the benevolent spirits, and ends with a prayer for a good harvest and health. The rite is concluded with a sevenfold piring . Afterwards the farm is under restrictions ( mali ) for three nights."
330,"When the rice ripens and is nearly ready to harvest, the introductory rites of matah padi take place. The tuai burong and family heads sit on a mat ( tikai ) at a point on the farm track ( jalai umai ) not far from the farms. No one, not even the women back at the longhouse, may bathe ( nadai tau mandi ) lest the feathers of birds be wet ( basah bulu burong )--similar to the restriction when the Iban are seeking auguries for new farm-land. Once seated, the tuai burong may not move ( nadai tau nginsit ); if he does, the rice will refuse to be harvested ( padi enggai diketau ). When they have heard seven Nendak calls on the left and seven on the right and the tuai burong has obtained an equivalent number of omen-sticks, a piring is prepared. This is sevenfold, corresponding to the number of calls, and arranged in two portions, according to the sides. Only if the community has decided to celebrate an elaborate festival which includes the timang incantation, are the kayu burong then carried back to the longhouse. Otherwise, they are taken to the farms. At the farm further piring sacrifices are prepared by the place where the seed baskets were at planting: one on the ground, one on a raised support. The Iban calls first on evil-minded spirits not to interfere or make trouble and declares his intention. All bilek members are expected to be present, since, like manggol , the harvest concerns the family and the fortune of one is the fortune of all. The senior bilek member sits on the ground with three rice stalks ( tiga pun ) between his legs. Tied to them is a left-side Nendak omen-stick ( Nendak kiba ) and surrounding them a length of thread, dyed red ( ubong mansau ). The red thread also encircles the foot of a raised piring . There is a second piring on the ground. With his fingers the Iban breaks off seven ears of rice immediately to his right. He may not use the reaping instrument ( ketap ) during the matah padi ritual and he must not separate the rice ears from the surrounding leaf lest the rice be embarrassed at its nakedness ( malu telanjai ). The rice is placed with the pulut rice in the piring . Opposite the Iban sits a woman, usually his wife, neither up-river ( ulu ) nor down-river ( ili ), and she plucks seven heads of rice to his left. Both must remain in the same position throughout the rite."
331,"The harvest proper is preceded by another ritual called nganjong ka penyedai (literally ‘carry to the mat’), although when the rice ripens early the distinction between matah padi and nganjong ka penyedai is less clear. Penyedai is the name given to a plaited mat which is placed under the carrying baskets ( lanji ) when the rice is being transferred from harvesting-baskets ( sintong ). After the appropriate omens (Nendak, Beragai) have been heard, the ritual begins. Two piring are prepared: one is offered to the spirit of the earth, one is placed in a raised support. At the same time the Iban calls on the prosperous rice spirits to ensure a good harvest. Then before spreading out the penyedai mat the Iban shakes it and wishes away undesirable, evil-minded spirits. Underneath the penyedai are left-side Nendak omen-sticks ( Nendak kiba ) to help ‘pitch up’ ( nyagu ) the rice from below, and, in the support at the side, right-hand Nendak sticks ( Nendak kanan ) to ‘hold the rice on the surface’ ( ngatong ). The penyedai not only serves the practical purpose of catching rice grains which might fall when these are poured from sintong to lanji , but it is also the spirit assembly place for the rice spirits. The rite is designed to encourage the prosperous rice spirits to make this, in particular, their home and not to stray elsewhere. Throughout the harvest, it is thought vital that the samengat padi should have access to and from the penyedai . Reaping must be done in such a way that the samengat can retreat through standing plants to the penyedai , or at least never find itself cut off and stranded in a clearing. A path through the farm must remain as a ‘bridge’ for the samengat padi , and no one is allowed to cross this at critical times."
332,
333,"Elegy-weeping, uxtisé for deceased. The men utter cries and imprecations against those who caused the death; because every death, so they think, is a true murder perpetrated by some enemy by means of a malefice. The women too, appropriately called uxt ĩ ra (Uaupés uxt ĩ na ), mourners, between exclamations and with very sentimental thoughts, do the eulogy of the dead and imprecate against the pajés or persons who cast the spell, the alleged causa mortis . They lower their heads, draw the hair over the face, the tears come in abundance, and they constantly collect them with the index finger of the right hand and shake them to the ground. And they proceed in this way for a long time, in a characteristic intonation, in which they go from the lowest notes to the shrillest ones. And the mourners succeed one another in turn in this panegyric-imprecatory weeping."
334,"Girls initiation and defloration. The girl must then be separated from the inhabitants of the maloca. During this time, which runs from three days to four weeks, according to the tribe, the young girl will always be shut in, she cannot take a bath, she will go out only when necessary and quickly, trying not to meet anyone. There, while the girl is kept seated on a stool, her hair will be cut by a woman who is called mõ-paxkoá , that is, godmother of initiation. The Mõ-paxkoá or the mother herself in some tribes pours water with pepper through her nose, using a funnel of the leaf of “in order to become illuminated”. When the cutting of the hair and the painting of the face have been done, no person may enter the place of seclusion except the pajé or Ko-m [unknown]u, the young man, and the girl’s mother (and, lacking the latter, the grandmother or woman on whom the young woman depends), and the Mõ-paxkoá herself. She will fast a great deal; the only foods permitted. She will, moreover, be subjected to painful tests: she will spend long hours seated on the floor and all of the last night in vigil. The pajé or the Ko-m ũ, bending over the fire, covers her with a strainer, and he will “blow” over her, while she remains seated, with her head bowed upon her crossed arms. After having blown over her with the smoke of his cigar, pronouncing at the same time a long and unintelligible exorcism, the copulation takes place. The rite ends with a bath of the dawn, Wáwa-’kãsé"
335,"Fruit house ritual. In short, Hallucinogenic drugs are taken and sacred instruments played over fruit. Ritual is only for men. The men bathe and prepare the instruments at the river and then walk back to the house playing as they come. They walk in pairs, usually with the trumpets in the lead, with short flutes and then long flutes behind them. The He players carry small bunches of fruits on their shoulders and more men walk behind carrying baskets loaded with fruit (see plate 2). The procession enters the door, goes twice (clockwise) round the dance path and then up the middle of the house to the screen where the baskets of fruit are deposited alongside other baskets already there. Generally, several different kinds of fruit are brought in. As the fruit is brought in there are shouts of ‘hoo hoo hoo hoo’ and much joking, often of a sexual nature and referring to mythical characters connected with forest fruits. During the morning the men paint themselves with black paint called we. All morning the shaman(s) sits, either by post 1 or post 7 next to the baskets of fruit, blowing spells into gourds containing various substances which are consumed during the rite. He blows over beer which is then drunk off the ends of sticks from a gourd placed in the middle of the house, before being consumed from gourds in the usual way. He also blows over yagé ( Banisteriopsis ) bark which is afterwards added to the rest of the bark being pounded in preparation of the drink. He blows over coca, over a large ceremonial cigar and over a gourd of snuff from which the men eat small pinches when it is placed in the middle of the house. In the late morning all the men assemble in the middle of the house between posts 1 and 2, sitting on ritual stools, and the senior host elder leads them all in chanting. During this chanting the coca and ritual cigar, blown over by the shaman, are handed round. At the same time yagé is served to all by the shaman. Following this the He are played again. Then, as the long flutes are played up and down the middle of the house, the elders and shaman tip the fruit out on to flat basketwork trays, throwing the empty baskets over the screen into the rear of the house. This is done with shouts of ‘hoo hoo hoo’ and with exchanges of ritualised joking. Once the fruit has been tipped into the trays, the trumpets are periodically played with their ends circling directly over the fruit, wafting it with their breath. The tipping out of the fruit marks a distinct phase in the rite; up to this point the long flutes are played only sporadically by men wearing few or no ornaments. After this, the long flutes are played in relay more or less continuously by pairs of elders wearing diadem-like crowns on their heads. By mid-afternoon the playing of the long flutes reaches a climax. Everyone present, except the shamans and the long-flute players, comes and eats a small pinch of coca. Then they all line up clutching thin wooden staves in their hands like spears and run up and down the edges of the house in a crouching position making aggressive, grumbling noises. This action, called acting-out spearing ( besu[unknown] kesose), is done with greatest enthusiasm by the younger men. Immediately after this, one of the elders burns lumps of beeswax in a potsherd, walking twice round the house clockwise, up the middle to the fruit and then back down the house to the front door where he leaves the smoking wax. As he does this he is followed round by young men playing trumpets with the flutes following behind. They are then played out of the house along the same route as the trumpets. As the He are taken out, the men collect up the stools, the yagé pot and the various gourds blown over by the shaman and, taking them with them, go and sit out in front of the house on the plaza. There the shaman blows spells over bundles of panpipes and after each person has blown a short puff into the ends, they are handed round and played"
336,"Dance at the Fruit House. The overall pattern of the dance, consisting of a series of dance sets interspersed with sessions of chanting. As the dancing starts, the women partake of a communal meal in the centre of the house. Soon after they are offered the gourds containing snuff and wax-coca mixture from which the men ate whilst the He were still inside the house. The main dancers are distinguished from the rest by wearing the total complement of feathers, teeth belts, bark-cloth aprons. While the main dancers dance and chant, the other men sit talking and laughing and playing panpipes. One man, a specialist chanter, and often also the lead dancer, leads the chanting while the rest, seated in an oval round him, repeat each phrase in chorus. Each session is preceded by a long period during which each man receives coca, cigars and snuff from every other, starting with the chanter who hands round coca and snuff and a cigar, all of which have had spells blown over them by the shaman. The two longest and most important sessions, giving coca ( kahi ejag[unknown] ) and pouring out beer ( idire iog[unknown] ) are held around midnight and dawn respectively. The former chant refers largely to the mythical origins of the various varieties of coca and how these were obtained from the group’s ancestors, whilst the latter refers to the origins of beer and the manioc used to make it. Shortly after the end of the dance, all the men go down to the river to bathe and vomit, having previously wiped snuff, blown by the shaman, on their knees and legs to prevent aches and pains caused by contact with water after dancing and wearing feathers. On their return, the men are each given a small quantity of cassava bread and meka (large ground-living termites), blown over by the shaman, to eat. This is followed by a meal of the same. Soon after, fruit, smoked chilli pepper, salt and small fish called fish children ( wai rĩa ), cooked with manioc leaves or ‘spinach’ ( au, Phytolacca iconsandra ), are all blown over by the shaman and distributed to each man, after which a communal meal, of fish and ‘spinach’, is held."
337,"Fruit house, when used as first stage of male initiation. on the eve of the rite and during the rite itself, each time that blown snuff, coca, etc. was eaten, the young boys ate first. When blown tobacco snuff was administered through the bone tube on the eve of the rite, the boys were given such large doses that they choked and vomited and had to be forcibly restrained from running away. The other men were also given unusually large quantities of snuff. In addition to the usual round of shamanism preceding the rite, the shamans blew spells over whips made from peeled saplings with the twigs left on. On the morning of the ritual, while the other men bathed at the river, the three boys were given a special wash outside on the plaza. The two shamans blew tobacco smoke over the heads and hands of the boys who then washed their faces and hands from a bowl of water. This was the only occasion I witnessed on which the men bathed after the fruit had been taken into the house. Once washed the boys painted their legs with black we paint, and were dressed with newly ochred garters below their knees, clean white handkerchiefs round their necks and palm-leaf crowns on their heads. They were afterwards led inside the house where they were sat down in a group on a woven palm-leaf mat placed directly on the floor to the right of the men’s door. Before the tipping out of the fruit, the initiates were each given small pink berries of the Kana (Sabicea amazonensis) vine to eat which had previously been blown over by the shaman. They were then called up to help tip out the fruit, but apart from this and when they were playing the short flutes or taking substances blown by the shaman, they sat silent and motionless on their mat. During the rite the boys were given large quantities of yagé, each time served to them in a very ritualised and formal manner. This was the first time they had ever taken yagé. The yagé used was also much stronger than usual - a larger-than-usual amount of leaf yagé. The main difference between this and other Fruit House rites observed by me came after the burning of the beeswax. All afternoon the shamans had flicked their whips making a loud swishing noise and once the wax had been burned this noise reached a crescendo. A young man of about twenty went out to the middle of the house near the screen where he was whipped by the two shamans. He then ran up and down the house acting-out spearing. Then the two shamans were whipped by two host elders, again followed by acting-out spearing"
338,"He House, similar to proceedings of Fruit house except that the real He instruments are used, these are even more sacred than the ones used at the Fruit house. The rite takes three days, beginning and ending in the evening. The He instruments are brought up from the river, where they are stored under water, at dusk. The initiates do not enter the ceremonies until dusk the next day. On the first night, young men remain outside on the plaza with the instruments while the elders chant inside. The instruments are brought in at dawn and during the day the participants receive red paint and snuff they take a ritual bathe with the instruments and begin to drink the beer. At dusk, the initiates, who have had their hair cut and their bodies painted black all over by women, are carried in the house from the plaza on the shoulders of elders. Once inside, they are given kana berries to eat, sat in a fetal position and administered their first ritual coca, puff on the ceremonial cigar and sip of yagé. After that they watch the instruments being paraded round. At midnight they play the smallest flutes, walking slowly and crouching down so that the ends almost touch the ground. Meanwhile, the elder in charge of the initiates burns beeswax from the ritual gourd. This is the climax of the rite and the women should be hidden in the forest for fear of smelling the aromatic smoke. Immediately afterwards, two ancestral spirits, He wãtia, appear, represented by elders playing a particular pair of flutes (Old Macaw) and dressed in the fullest possible array of sacred regalia. Then the participants eat coca from the gourd containing sacred beeswax ( werea koa ) and wipe snuff behind their knees from another gourd ( m[unknown]no koa ). Next, the shaman whips all the participants in turn. As they assemble for whipping, the participants make a mock battle-charge brandishing. Later, the initiates and young men paint each other with black paint and following this, in the past, the initiates would have had the He instruments played over their naked penises and then, in the nude, they would play their short flutes. Chanting and playing of He continue through the next day. That night the participants are allowed to sleep for the first time since the beginning of the rite. They lie on mats which are placed at the female end of the house and which are covered in ta boti, the whitish grass that carpets the sky where Romi Kuru lives. The next morning there is a ritual bathing, during which the instruments are also immersed. The participants vomit to rid themselves of He rima, ancestral poison, and before they enter the house the women remove the food and goods onto the plaza. Ants, termites and starch cassava are shamanically treated and thereafter these can be eaten; however, the meals must be out on the plaza and the initiates eat their cassava impaled on a twig of a ritual whip to avoid heating it in their hands. After the shamanism, the instruments are returned to the river and the initiates installed in a woven palm-leaf enclosure constructed near the men’s door."
339,"The óyne, mourning ceremony, consists of two parts: a long, three-day section, followed about a month later by a one-day concluding ceremony at which the spirit of the dead is finally evicted from the community. During the first part, masked dancers impersonate many of the familiar beasts, birds, insects, and fish, as well as the mischievous spirits of the Cubeo world. These spirit beings come to mourn, but mainly to turn the people from grief. On this occasion the tribal “grand-mother” and her consort, in the form of two great bark trumpets, also arrive to mourn. The dances, rituals, and dramatic representations of these first three days range over a variety of themes, but all have the common purpose of transforming grief and anger to joy. In keeping with the characteristic pattern of Cubeo ritual that begins slowly and solemnly and ends in frenzied disorder, the first phases of the óyne also start from the dark mood of grief and anger and end in a sexual orgy. This first part of the óyne, in which the emphasis is upon transformation of feeling, is largely dramatic. The second part of the óyne, that lasts from late afternoon until the dawn of the following day, carries forward the theme of emotional transformation, ending in fact in true sexual license, when men are privileged to copulate with their sib and phratry brothers’ wives. masked dancers represent the nonhuman world of beings, the beneficent and malevolent, the threatening and the ludicrous, as well as the neutral creatures. In the course of the ceremonies, the relationship between the nonhuman world of the masked representations and the people, represented by the women, becomes increasingly more intimate, culminating, as we have already noted, in the total intimacy of coitus. Men eat little or nothing during the three days of the óyne . They are nourished on chicha and blunt their hunger and fatigue with coca. The first phase of the óyne concludes on the morning of the fourth day. Despite the drinking and the exhaustion of frenzied dancing the departures are as formal as the arrivals. The hosts form their line at the doorway and the guests pass along, exchanging final expressions of grief. Men embrace one another and weep. Women weep once more with women. Before he leaves the house, each man presents the host with the masks he has brought, including all its ornaments"
340,"One month after the óyne a concluding and simpler ceremony is held. On the first evening the masks dance again and the Xudjiko is sounded. At dawn the masks and their ornaments, as well as all the ceremonial paraphernalia made specifically for the óyne including the trumpets, are burned in a great fire on the front plaza. Not all the masks are destroyed, because the children are privileged to reclaim any they wish from the flames. The burning puts an end to the jurisdiction over the house of the spirit representations and officially concludes the mourning. That evening the final dance is held. The house has now been restored to a normal ceremonial state, and the dances of this evening include men and women. They dance the ordinary dances of the drinking parties and conclude with a great circle dance within the house that includes all men, women, and youngsters. This dance is known as kompaíndüwü (going home). The dance forms on the plaza and circles about a fire in the center of the house, moving clockwise and then reversing. The men are fully ornamented and carry stamping tubes; a woman dances between two men. They sing a refrain, kenadjú marić kenadjú pimáir . Periodically a woman dancer screams loudly in a high-pitched voice, breaking in upon the somber melody. As this dance continues through the night, couples break away and leave for the brush behind the house. They copulate, return to the dance, and seek new sexual partners. At this point the dance has become chaotic. Finally, the younger men of the sib burn dry capsicum peppers in the maloca to drive away the ghost of the recently deceased. Thereafter, the deceased is to be forgotten and his name not mentioned for at least another generation."
341,"Washing akombo, (1) Ta Ichegher or ta ikegher= to make two piles of symbols, usually but not always leaves, on the ground, and to pour water onto the ground between them to form a “stream.” If the akombo is being washed in the streambed, then either one ichegher is put on each side of a small stream, or a small inlet is found, so that one can be put on each side, with the inlet of water between them. (2) Kuna = to touch the chicken or other sacrificial animal on the ichegher and any other emblems that may be called for in the specific ritual, then to the person who is benefitting by the ritual--the spot on the body of the beneficiary changes from one akombo to another. (3) Chia = this word means to move the sacrificial chicken back and forth over the “stream”--toward the beneficiary and away from him, in a kind of swinging motion. (4) Wua = to kill. But the sacrifice is by no means always killed in akombo washing, as it invariably is in akombo repairing. However, if it is to be done, it will be done at this point. (5) Sunda = “to smear.” That is, to drip the blood of the sacrifice onto the ichegher and on the body of the beneficiary. This word may or may not include plucking feathers from the chicken and sticking them to the blood on emblems and beneficiary. (6) Mishi = sprinkle. This is usually done by wetting a branch, the sacrificial chicken or something else and sprinkling water across either chest or back or both of the beneficiary. (7) Kure = “to finish completely.” This includes the ritual of hamber ifan on the part of everyone concerned, to indicate that they do not have any reservations about wanting it to be effective. (8) Nambe = pay."
342,"Repairing akombo: first of all the persons concerned perform the hamber ifan ritual to show they have no reservations; then the beneficiary is put into touch with the akombo emblems, after which a chicken or other sacrificial animal is killed on the emblems and its blood used to make a connection between the person and the emblems. Then comes a major break in the ceremony, while the animals are cooked--payment is usually arranged during that period. The second phase of the ceremony is involved with the eating of the meat of the sacrificial animals. The beneficiary is first put into touch with the emblems via the meat of the sacrifice, portions of it are thrown to the east and to the west in a very overdetermined and compact ritual that has been reported by all observers of the Tiv but not, we think, adequately explained by any of them. Then the akombo meat is eaten, by the beneficiary (although in some akombo, the beneficiary, if she is a woman, cannot eat it and must give it to a husband or a brother--which one depending on the akombo concerned) and by the officiants and everyone present who has “seized” the akombo . All except the beneficiary may hand out meat to others, any sacredness staying with them and the meat thereafter merely being meat. At the end, the akombo is washed, see above."
343,"Ityumbun wan rite. Emblems of fourteen akombo are all put onto a winnowing tray and a calabash of water is brought. The child’s mother was told to sit under the eaves of her hut. She put the baby on her outstretched legs, resting its head on her knees, with its feet toward her. The process then was for Une then to drip a bit of water into the mouth of the child from each of the emblems on the tray. With each emblem, a chant is repeated, “I tumbu you swende .” This is said two or three times, as water is dripped off the swende emblem into the mouth of the child. Finally, the statement is made, “The sun should not shine upon you, but should always shine on the ground.” This was repeated fourteen times, once for each akombo. When this was finished, Une picked up the winnowing tray with the emblems still on it and made a circular motion in the air with it three times, saying, “ hwa , hwa , hwa .” He then put the tray on the ground, crossed his hands, picked up the leaves, but not the other emblems, handed the leaves to the mother, who also crossed her hands over one another. She then handed the leaves back to him, into his other hand, and he handed them back to her again. This was done seven times, and was called chia of the emblems. The leaves were then put into the thatch of her hut. The mother then stands and takes one step out from under the thatch, with her right foot, Une draws a line over which she must next step, and as she does so, he pours water onto both sides of her. She is now outside, and Une ties a piece of raffia around the neck of the child, with the words, “ M dzel u bum vo .” This means, “I tie a bum on you.” The bum should mean “oath”. Une then took a bit of the child’s hair, mixed it with a bit of the mother’s hair, and put both into a small hole that he dug into the wall of the hut. He then took dust from the doorstep and put it into the mother’s hand. He did this into each hand three times. Then the dust was poured back onto the ground."
344,"Senda Hwav, this is a ceremony for “closing the fontanelle.” Chia explained that when a child is old enough that his mother is ready to have another child, that this ceremony must be performed. They say that if it is not done, the child may die and the mother will not be able to have another Atsegher had taken a long branch of custard apple ( hul ) and attaches mud sphere, sherds, an egg, feather and other items to it. The hul to the roof of the hut. Both egg and millet had been provided by the child’s mother. She also gave Atsegher a small bit of camwood. He mixed the camwood in his left hand with his right fingers into a paste, and made a mark with the camwood lengthwise around the oval of the egg. He touched it to the millet, and touched each sherd and each branch with the camwood. He made three strokes with the camwood on each side of the doorway, just below the sill. Meanwhile, the mother had sat under the eaves, beside the two upright sticks, holding the child in her lap, and nursing it. Atsegher smears camwood on the right hand, the right shoulder, and on the forshead of the mother, and then on the right hand of the child. Atsegher takes a young cockrel, touches it to the child, and then hangs the cockrel by the neck under the eaves of the hut. Atsegher then removes it and slits its throat. He smears a little blood on each side of the door, on each of the two branches, then drips blood onto the sill. He puts feathers from the breast of the chicken in each of these places. The child is now smeared with blood on the back of his right hand, and this is followed by a few feathers. The chicken is then dispatched by bashing its head on the ground. The chicken was cooked by Ende, the child’s father and eaten. Everybody has, at one time or another, had a ceremony performed for him for closing the fontanelle, he obviously doesn’t remember it, if he doesn’t get sick from eating this chicken, it’s proof positive that the ceremony was performed. Bark twine or cotton is tied around the childs neck and waist. In the evening the child is bathed in the stream. The twine around his neck is removed, meaning that he can now bathe in the stream anytime he pleases."
345,"There were a number of women inside this hut, and when the body was carried in, they began the wailing that is composed of a combination of ululation and dirges. The wailing was continued until the body was brought out again for. A man from the group of sons-in-law and their kinsmen and representatives danced toward the reception hut wall and fired a Dane gun, pointing it into the reception hut. Although there was powder in it, it contained no ball. There is a collection and discussion of fines sent by people who are unable to attend. Chenge then asked Usaka to bring the women out. Another shot is fired at the door of the hut where the women wail. The women and girls proceeded in single file down a path leading to the outskirts of the compound. They continued their wailing, both while they were walking, and through the ensuing ceremony. There was, during the rest of the ceremony, no female within the compound. When the women were out of sight, Shitaa took up the kor horn, which had just been made, and as the body was brought out of the hut, Shitaa began to blow on the horn. “Ambe has died. Ambe is coming to meet you.” There then followed a list of the well-known dead members of the lineage. A boy of about six--Ambe’s son’s son--came forward and was given a little piece of camwood. The chest of the corpse was uncovered, and the boy smeared a little bit of the camwood onto the corpse, just above and outside the right nipple. The boy held the head of the chick in his left hand. Nor held the body of the chick, and with his other hand guided the boy’s right hand while he nicked the neck of the chick to draw blood. He was then told to take the chick and throw it into the bush. When he came back, he was handed a small calabash cup of water by one of the members of MbaJiabu. The child was told to pour a little of the water into the loose earth that had come out of the grave. And then he stuck his finger in it and smeared a bit of the mud on the right foot of the corpse. The corpse is lifted into the grave. Then each began to throw dirt into the grave. During the time that the grave was being filled, several members of MbaWandia took some dance steps in the center of the compound, each rushing toward the grave and making threatening gestures toward it with a spear. When the dancers had again sat down, Nor picked up the swem and carried it towards the path along which we had all come in. Holding it high in front of him and above his head, he allowed it to drop. The sherd broke, and the ashes scattered. Gbaka told me that the purpose of the breaking of the swem was that now no misfortunes would follow any of the spectators home."
346,"Akombo igbe, when a man wishes to become initiated into the cult so that he has power over the ikombo he prepares a brew of beer and when this is ready the elders and other initiates assemble. The elder who performs the rite prepares a fresh young palm frond and ties bits of raw cotton to the end of each leaf, which is called the kwagh megh ku igbe (the medicine of the igbe ); then he procures the complete neck of a broken pot and ties palm leaves round it which is called the cicever . These are placed on the ground and the elder puts red camwood on the kwagh megh and on the right hand and right shoulder of the man being initiated and he does the same to the family elder on the right temple. Then a chicken is produced and, after being swung around the head of the initiate, it is killed and the blood dripped on the kwagh megh and on the right hand and right shoulder of the initiate. The chicken is cooked with the ordinary yam mash ( ruam ), and at sunset when this is ready the elder takes a pinch and throwing it over his right shoulder to the east he says, ‘I yange wan nomso’ (The sun is a young man), and then to the west saying, ‘Uwer wan kwase’ (The moon is a young girl). Then he places a little food on the kwagh megh and feeds some to the initiate in the ceremonial manner, moving his hands backwards and forwards as if in hesitation, the initiate doing the same and then feeding the elder in the same way. He then takes a small gourd of beer, pours some on the kwagh megh and hands it to the initiate who takes a sip and passes it round. When darkness comes, they all go behind the compound except the initiate who is left in a hut with a covering over the door. The skin of a leopard, or rather an imitation one, is put on a man and a knife is put in each of his hands which are called his claws. The man thus dressed jumps about miming the actions of the leopard and the elders advance with lighted grass torches, called the ‘ igbe fire’, singing ‘Anyam due vo’. Then they sit in the common hut and the initiate is called out from the hut and he emerges behind an igba . The cloth of the igba encircling them both, they advance cautiously towards the elders. The leopard careers about and the initiate has to touch it. This he does when the leopard, who makes constant miming attempts to scratch him with his claws, has his back to him. The elders then receive him."
347,"The ceremony for the establishing of the ihambe. This ritual is associated with the fertility of the wife. The posts were carefully prepared and laid on the ground before the door of the hut, and the man, the husband, and his wife for whom the ihambe was being set up stood on either side of them. The elder took a cock in his right-hand and a gourd of water in his left. He poured a little water from the gourd on the cock and on the posts, he touched the post with the cock and then the husband on the chest and back and twirled it round his head. Then he did the same to the wife. Next he walked six paces to the left from the door of the hut to where a hole had been dug and he placed an iron ring in this. The earth was then put back in the hole and the mound formed and the emblems planted on it. He then cut off the head of the cock, dripped blood on the post or posts and placed the head on the male post. The feathers of the cock were then burnt off and it was cooked. When it was ready, yam food was produced and the elder placed a little of the chicken and some yam food on the posts. Next he threw morsels of food east and west over his shoulder saying, ‘The sun is a young man, the moon is a maiden’ and, taking another pinch, he passed it round the husband’s head three times and fed him with it over the emblems in the ceremonial manner, the one offering and withdrawing and the other receiving with hesitation. Then he put the wings on some food and repeated the process with the wife."
348,"Iwo Yangen object was to overawe or to prevent mbatsav (witches) from destructive acts which affected the life of the people. It might take place at the breaking of new farms or at times of crises. For the ceremony, the Ityelan or guardian arch, consisting of two posts with a cross bar hung with streamers of ayande fronds, was erected on a path running east and west on the family group boundary. Near this a small mound of earth was raised and a small platform of forked posts and crosspieces was constructed and also festooned with ayande fronds. On the platform were grass representations of the male and female genital organs, and against the platform was placed a log of wood some five feet high representing, as I was told, a suggestion of the yams of the coming crop. At the foot of the platform were some millet seeds, a coco-and a wild yam—ancestral foods—whilst below on the mound was a prepared swem pot. The elders of the Nongov-Turan family group assembled for the ceremony. When all was ready, the senior elder planted the millet, the coco-and wild yams at the foot of the platform and took his place in front of the other elders facing east. He called three times, ‘Ho! inongo’ (Ho! family group) and each time the other elders responded, ‘Ho-o’, Then he put his hands on the swem pot and said, ‘If I cause the land to be harmed ( vihi tar ) let swem kill me. If amongst you any man does harm ( vihi tar ) to the land let swem kill him’. The other elders responded, ‘I agree’. The elder then took the swem pot in his hands and led the other elders round and through the iwo yangen with him, calling out loudly, ‘Ibo-o’ and the elders replying, ‘Ho-o’ . Then the elder replaced the swem pot on the mound and gave each other elder a frond of ayande and they went off home"
349,"The swende u ombor takes place in the compound. The woman is always accompanied by her husband and a pre-puberty virgin, and the motions are gone through with a little channel made in the ground in the direction east and west in which the water is cast from a small gourd with the spoken formula. The performer of the rite, who always was, it seems, a man of slave origin, tied a string round her neck and another round her waist. He placed some wild pawpaw leaves on the ground on either side of the little channel and put wet mud and gruel on them. Then he took a cock and leaf in his right hand and another leaf in his left and touched the woman with them on the chest and back and twirling the cock round her head said, ‘I am performing swende for you in case you have seen a man killed by swende, in case you have seen a dead man in a grave, in case you have talked with a swende initiate or in case you have killed a dog or stepped over a dog’s bone.’ Next he threw water from the little gourd into the little channel west saying, ‘Ibo sen; Ibo sen’ (Evil flow away). He killed the cock by dashing its head on a stone and, taking out the crop, he put it on wet mud and plastered it on the woman’s navel. Then he cut the strings and sprinkled a little water on the woman with a leaf and left the compound in silence, taking the chicken with him. The strings tied round the neck and waist of the woman had, it is understood, the object of keeping evil (spirits) from entering her body and endangering the child until the risk of that was reduced by the drawing off of the evil thing into the chicken."
350,"The swende u ndor was performed in all cases of men involved in the shedding of human blood or men who had helped in the burying of a man killed by swende . It is said that in the old days it would be performed for a man who had mourned one whose death was due to the sasswood ordeal or smallpox. In this the scapegoat idea is present—the transference of evil from the body of the man being purged to an animal or bird. The performer was always a man, the product of a slave marriage or perhaps a descendant of such, that is, someone who is outside the risk of contamination in the family. He went down to the stream with the man to be purged following. He placed mud on leaves of the wild pawpaw on either bank and then took a chicken (in some Tiv clans it is said a dog) and touched the leaves on either bank with it and the man to be purged on the chest and back. Then he twirled the chicken round his head and repeated a formula such as, ‘I am performing swende for you because you have killed a man’. Then holding the chicken by the legs he splashed it down stream saying ‘Ibo sen; Ibo sen’ —(Evil flow away) and then up stream saying, ‘Ish[unknown] k[unknown]ndo; ish[unknown] k[unknown]ndo’ (Innocence come up) and dashing the head of the chicken on a stone, he took out the crop and put the contents on a leaf on the right bank and threw the chicken away into the stream"
351,"The rite of itimbe mku is undertaken when man has portent dream or is failing in hunting. At night he will go with a qualified man and the elder and the prepared posts to the spot where the symbol is to be placed (an igba will already have made a fire there). The performer of the rite places the post or posts prepared with the grass dressing in position and then, taking a chicken, he touches the post and a stone with it, then he touches the suppliant on the back and chest with it and twirls it round his head three times. He then cuts off the head of the chicken and lets the blood flow into the saucer. This he mixes with camwood into a paste and puts a little on the right temple of the suppliant and on the post. He next takes ikehegh (pepper) seeds and touches the hands, feet and shoulders of the suppliant with them three times and chewing the seeds he spits them out east and west and on the itimbe mku . This process is then repeated by the suppliant. The chicken is then cooked with yam food and palm oil and some of this with special portions of the chicken—the liver, heart and head—are first circled round the itimbe mku and then handed to the suppliant in the ceremonial manner. He holds out his hands and withdraws them six times as the elder offers and withdraws until finally it is put into his hands to consume. The performers of the rite continue to feed each other in this way but the remainder of the food is left in the saucer and on the stone."
352,"Ikombo mku. This is not the same as the itimbe mku (above). If evil happens in a family such as sickness, food shortage or lack of success in hunting and the diviner discovers that the dead ( mbakuuv ) are the cause, these rites are carried out. The performer of the rite will take the ‘food of the mbakuuv ’ a white cock, some millet and cocoyams and a frond of the iyande to a wild plum-tree ( vitex cienkowskii ) in a grove. There he will kill the cock and drip the blood at the foot of the tree. After cooking the cock he then leaves it with the other things at the foot of the tree and returns to the compound. Later he returns to the tree with some ordinary food ( ruam ) which he also leaves, and last of all he returns and brings back the pots—the gifts have been accepted. During the evening there is complete silence and when night has well advanced the performer of the rites goes into the bush and calls, ‘I have put right the mbakuuv, let every woman put a yam at her door’. In the morning these yams have gone"
353,"Akombo Agbande, this rite is performed for a woman with child. The ceremony is as follows: The woman kneels on one knee before the performer of the rite. He takes a chicken and he touches her breast with it repeating a formula each time he does so such as ‘For the akombo; for the bull-roarer; for the imbor; for the leopard; for the ivuul (a hollow wooden instrument with notches on the face which makes a loud rasping noise when a cow’s jaw bone is drawn over it)’. Then he dashes the chicken’s head on a stone killing it and, cutting out the entrails with a knife, he takes some of the excreta on his finger and places it on the woman’s big toe. Then he takes some of this off the big toe and plasters it on the navel. At night, the ceremony for the expulsion of evil takes place. At this ceremony, as I actually heard it one night in Ukum, a multiplicity of sound, of confused whirl and discord is produced. The ancestral gbande drum, a small ceremonial drum open at one end is used, the imbor is sung through, the ivuur is used to great effect and bull-roarers are operated. A model of the leopard is always displayed and sometimes dancing figures appear wearing a cloth or a string net mask called iba."
354,"The ingbianjol rites are those performed by women alone, and the most important of these is performed for a woman with child. An old woman above the age of childbirth and who has ceased to co-habit with a man is the performer; she is often herself called ingbianjol . She comes bearing the fronds of the adzool and places two fronds on the ground and also two sticks with a stone and a saucer between. She places the woman with child sitting to the east of this and pours a little water on a cock and touches the adzool, the saucer and the breast and back of the woman with it and then swings it round the head three times. Next she swings it along a little channel in the ground with the formula ‘ ibo sen, ibo sen—isho kondo, isho kondo ’. After which the woman stands up and the old woman produces a small snail shell and touches her feet with it saying, ‘ikor’ (snail shell). Then she touches her knee with it and says, ‘gbatsenger’ (kneecap). After this the old woman takes a bundle of grass plaited to resemble the female genitalia and touches her on the shoulder with it saying, ‘akuul u kwase’ (the genitals of a woman). Then she puts her fingers on wet earth and the adzool and touches the stone and then the woman on the navel and releases the cock, for no chicken is killed in a woman’s akombo."
355,"Boy’s initiation .—A Cainguá boy undergoes something of an initiation rite when, prior to puberty, his lower lip is perforated for the insertion of a labret. After a group of boys has been somewhat anesthetized with beer, a specialist perforates each boy’s lower lip with a wooden or deer-horn awl and prays to Tupã that the labret may protect its wearer against death. For the three following days the initiates eat only maize mush. After their initiation they drop the infantile “u, u” (yes) for the adult masculine “ta.”"
356,"Ñembo’é usually begins at dusk. the tamoí to poraé, singing, slowly rising and falling in pitch, in contrast to the sharp staccato of his mbaraká. His wife and daughters soon pick up the chant. After long minutes of chanting, utters a low, mournful call and shakes his mbaraká continuously, signaling closure and a short rest. Soon they begin again. Later the crowd gathers in front of an altar consisting of 2 posts 1m apart with a string between them holding a variety of ornaments. The momentum of the poraé grows and Avarijú leaves his hammock to join the standing men, moving back and forth between them and the altar and periodically facing the altar to stare into space. The energy of the group builds as the sound grows. Men move back and forth with a short, shuffling step, and women, now standing in a line behind the men, keep rhythm by moving several steps from side to side. When the noise and energy seem to fill the house to overflowing, the tamoí leads the group outside onto the dance ground. The two lines of men and women fall in behind him, continuing to mark time with steps, voices, mbaraká and takuará. They dance counterclockwise around the kãnguijý vat, returning to position in front of the tataendy’ý. After periods of intense chanting, the tamoí imparts his divinely inspired vision to the group. This message often directly reflects sources of anxiety felt by the tamoí, problems faced by the community, or collective enterprises undertaken by the group. Before a visit to another community, the poraéa will often express concern for safety during the trip. At other times, the vision is designed to educate the community in the proper manner of behavior, offer advice and direction, or give a stern lecture or verbal castigation. Tamoí determine the length and frequency of ñembo’é. Usually, the group will gather for several hours. Avarijú chants for periods of twenty to thirty minutes, then returns to his hammock and rests, closing his eyes to receive new visions. During the interim, the group disbands to rest, unless other, less experienced tamoí continue the poraé. A troubled tamoí may poraé like this every night for months, but the size of the gatherings decreases as he saps the energy of his supporters. In the end, the tamoí will be accompanied only by his most loyal family members and friends"
357,"In Itanaramí, the ñembo’é culminates each month with the drinking of kãnguijý during the full moon. Relatives from neighboring communities join the festivities. On nights of the kãnguijyápe, a long and intense ñembo’é is followed by drinking and celebration. As the ñembo’é finishes, Avarijú calls for a calabash of kãnguijý. After intense poraé over the liquid, he draws from it a small object (Cadogan 1959a, 84, observed poraéa who produce a flower), to the amazement of all the youngsters who have gathered close. He then takes a drink and passes the liquid on to the yvyraijá. Soon, all the young women in the group are dishing out kãnguijý and distributing it to the crowd. Certain dances are ethnusiastically performed, particularly by young people. Drinking kãnguijý changes the tone of the evening, and although it contains little alcohol, the focus shifts from ñembo’é led by the religious leader to more worldly forms of celebration. The poraéa retires to his hammock and the group becomes raucous. All join in singing and dancing nonreligious music, and young people openly flirt with one another."
358,"If the monthly ñembo’é reaches its peak with the drinking of kãnguijý, the annual religious cycle culminates with the ñimongaraí, the Chiripá’s most important religious ceremony. The ritual has several purposes—first, to baptize new members of the group; second, to discover their names; and third, to celebrate the year’s new crops. In this, the religious leader reaches his most intense communication with the deities and “sees” the names of the newborns. The ceremony demands weeks of preparation: the dancing ground must be cleaned, the alter repaired, and kãnguijý prepared. Most importantly, a poraéa and members of his household and community exert themselves in increasingly long nights of ñembo’é. After several weeks of fervent activity, in the middle of the night, the tamoí gather to baptize each of the small children. Parents present themselves and their infants to the hammock of the most powerful tamoí. The carved baptismal font, with water and several thin strips of ygarý, is brought from the tataendy’ý, and a wick is lit to illuminate the scene. Each child in turn is held forth by its parents or “godparents” ( syangá or tuvangá ) and, as the tamoí remains in his hammock and continues his supplications, water is wiped onto the forehead and stomach of the newborn. The naming is done in the hours before the first light of day. As the tamoí continue their chanting, and men and women continue their support with mbaraká and takuará, the entire community assembles, facing east between the oguazú and the vat of kãnguijý. Parents take their children in arms. Accompanied by the other tamoí and the yvyraijá, Avarijú approaches the line. Each person is given a lit beeswax wick by the yvyraijá. Then Avarijú, shaking his mbaraká, singing, and holding his hands over and around the head and body of the individual, sees his or her téra ka’agúy. This process includes not only the newborns, but all people of Itanaramí. Adults receive their names again. In cases of extreme sickness, a new name is divined for the patient as a means of providing an identity that is free from illness. When the last names are given, the chanting of the tamoí reaches a final crescendo and stops. The dawn is welcomed with kãnguijý."
359,"Naming Ceremony takes place on the morning of the seventh day after birth. The essential features are the shaving of the child’ heads. It involves the saying of the appropriate prayers, the sacrifice of an animal, and the distribution of “charity”. After the shaving the child’s name was publicly announced. The formal name is chosen by the father or father’s sister, but the mother also picks a name by which the child is commonly known. The elders, led by the Imam, came over to the baby to pray, conveying blessing by spitting on the right hand and rubbing it lightly over the baby’s head, and spitting into its ears.The saliva of a religious teacher is infused with baraka (blessing). The call to prayer ( noda ) was recited into the baby’s right ear, followed by lihan , the same sequence but in which the Arabic phrases are said only once, into its left ear. The kola nuts from a clay pot were given to the two elderly women and the shaver. The grandmother then chewed a piece of kola and placed some on the fontanelle, as it is believed that this will ensure protection for a delicate spot. The hair shaved off was carefully gathered up lest any one with ill intent should get hold of it to work evil magic, and the child was taken back to be handed over to the mother. The baby’s hair may be kept by her in a place of safety, or made into an amulet to be worn by the child either in the form of a cord round the waist, or on the wrist. The other articles in the pot are kept for a while by the mother, but no great significance is attached to them. The baby is taken inside by an old woman, who passes the baby four times over the fireplace, the fire now being extinguished. She stands in front of the mother with the baby in her arms, and gives it her blessing by spitting on its face and then kissing it. She holds it in outstretched arms to the mother, but then brings it back to her body. This is repeated three times, and the fourth time she hands the child over, pronouncing its name. A second old woman was standing by during this rite holding a head of suna (early millet). The mother takes the baby and gives it her right breast, right being the side considered blessed. Then she lays it down on the bed, and the suna ear is dipped in water, which is then sprinkled over the child. Food is then distributed and followed by the sacrifice of a goat, the Imam saying the words of blessing, and cutting the animal’s throat as it lay neck turned towards the east."
360,"Circumcision takes place in the bush, and no women are allowed near. The boys are washed with medicine, and taken out of the village early in the morning, clothed in white, often escorted by their jam (father’s sister’s sons). They are expected to show no sign of fear, and it is considered meritorious for a boy to run away to be circumcised without the knowledge of his relatives, though the operation would not be performed until they had been told of his action and given their consent. The sons of the highest ranking men are operated on first. A shed (mbar) is built near the village, where the boys (now known as njuli ) stay until their wounds are healed. Women are not permitted to approach the shed, with the exception of the girl who brings water when the boys are temporarily away. Numerous ritual precautions are taken. A man with second sight ( kumah ) stays with the njuli day and night to prevent interference by witches. Special charms are made. A fire is kept burning continuously. The dress of a njuli consists of a white robe and a triangular-shaped hat of native cloth. He should never be bareheaded. He carries a thin rod in one hand, has a small ladle-shaped calabash hung round his neck, two sticks which he carries tied to the wrist, and a circular cover ( paka ) which he holds in front of his face if he comes near a woman. When greeting an elder he has to crouch down and touch his forehead to the ground. A njuli remains unwashed to avert the attention of malevolent spirits. In the evenings the njuli are taught various songs and beaten by the selbe should they fail to learn them properly."
361,"The first major ceremony, after male circumcision, in which the whole village is involved occurs with the appearance of a monster ( mam ) who comes to “eat” the boys. The monster is heard roaring in the night, and as it approaches the village, the women and girls rush indoors and hide. Later the selbe visit the village, beat on the cane house walls with their sticks until the women of compounds with boys in the mbar produce some kungutu (cake), hurriedly shutting their doors once they have done so. During the night a tall pole, 20 feet high or so, with a pot on the top is set up outside the mbar . This is called the s[unknown]chu mam , the chew-stick of mam"
362,"The next major ceremony is the Samba sho which can be witnessed by women. The selbe begin by performing a whipping dance. They parade rhythmically round the schu mam with a long thin stick in each hand; from time to time one stands still while another gives him a stroke on the back. The women come from the village, and the njuli are led out of the mbar and kneel down behind their krn-krn . The njuli then dance individually for a short spell to the accompaniment of the women’s clapping, after which the women dance in return. At sunset they are chased back to the village, and the boys go back to their shed."
363,"In the final ceremony, the shed is burnt early in the morning, and the boys are taken off to bathe. They put on new trousers and have their heads shaved into distinctive patterns. Henceforth they are known as huhaha . Later in the day they return to the village, and go in procession to the mosque, squatting down in front of it. Suna and cotton (the blessed crops) are put on their heads, and water sprinkled over them. The Imam thanks everybody for their help, and prayers are said. The boys then have the privilege of rushing off to seize any fowl on which they can lay their hands"
364,"Taka, Tying the marriage. generally held on a Friday after the mosque service and is performed by the Imam in the bride’s compound or in that of her patrilineage head. Her father or guardian, and the future husband’s father or guardian, and witnesses must be present. The woman’s presence is not required, and the groom is usually absent. A formal request for the woman in marriage is made. This request is granted, and the amount of the marriage-payments is discussed. Kolas are distributed to those present, and sent to absent kinsfolk. If the full marriage money is paid on the spot, the husband may take the bride back to his home or village almost immediately, but this does not usually happen unless she is a widow or divorcée. Usually there is a delay of several months between the “tying” of the marriage and the transfer of the bride to her husband’s home. Dancing, feasting, and firing of guns may follow in celebration"
365,"The mur , which is the covering of the bride and her formal transfer to her husband’s home, normally takes place towards the end of the dry season. During the Thursday evening the bride remains indoors in her mother’s house, while her jam (both of slave descent and father’s sister’s daughters) dance and sing for her. Later the old women of the compound bathe her and clothe her in white. Traditionally the bride weeps and shows great reluctance to leave her home. Next her head is covered with a white pagn (native cloth). She is then escorted by her mother and sisters to a mat spread out in the compound and made to sit down. The elders give her advice—to be faithful to her husband, to respect him and the men of his yard, to be obedient and carry out his commands, and to be as good as her mother was before her. Prayers are said that the marriage may be happy and fruitful. The bridal party, the girl escorted by her age mates, friends, jam , etc., and a few elderly women, moves slowly towards the groom’s house, the men firing guns, the girls singing ribald songs. They should arrive there in the early hours of the morning. The party first of all goes round the pencha (the abode of the village spirit) four times, and then enters the groom’s compound. Here the bride is formally handed over to the elders of her husband’s yard, who are enjoined to treat her well, and regard her as a daughter"
366,"When the time for burial draws near, the corpse is taken to the back yard to be ritually washed by a person of the same sex as the deceased, with water drawn fresh from the well. The orifices are closed with cotton. A few drops of perfume are sprinkled on the body and it is clothed in a white shroud, generally of locally made cloth. The body is then rolled in a mat, carried on men’s shoulders, and taken to the mosque, where it is laid on the ground outside the mosque facing east on its right side. Women do not accompany the funeral procession though a few elderly women may attend at a distance during the mosque service. The dead man’s name is announced, and the Imam asks the people to say what they know about him. Relatives and friends state that they knew him to be a good Muslim and praise him. The elders line up in front of the mosque and pray, though the young men present remain seated. When the prayer is finished all rise and the corpse is carried to the burial ground. All those present squat and bow down as the body is slowly lowered into the grave, where two men stand to receive it. The mat is unrolled from the body which is laid on its right side facing east. Leaves and sticks are put across the grave, some sticks being stuck into the side walls to take the weight. Earth is heaped on top. Water is brought for those concerned to wash their hands. After the body has been lowered into the grave further prayers are said, after which those present, as a final gesture, throw a small stone or piece of earth over which they have said a prayer, on to the grave. The mourners do not look back, for angels are believed to visit the grave as soon as they have turned their backs. They return to the mosque where a charity of kola nuts and cakes is given out. Shares are given to the grave-diggers, then the smiths, followed by the elders and representatives from other villages."
367,
368,"Funeral. At death the body was carried out of the lodge and cleaned, dressed in finery, and painted. The burial services took four days or less, with the body oriented toward the direction of the afterworld, south or west. Family members are concerned about the the deceased reaching the afterlife. Members made speeches to the deceased, giving advice and encouragement for the journey, especially to children, who would have a difficult crossing. They put food with the body so that the soul could consume it on the way. They placed tobacco with the body so that the soul could offer it to the dead and the leaders of the afterworld. At dusk following a death, and for the next three nights, the mourners lit fires to guide the ego-soul on its journey. The mourners conducted a feast on the fourth night, burning food for the consumption of the dead person, maintaining communion with the deceased through a shared meal. The burial ceremonies ended with dancing and singing, which matched the ceremonies that the deceased would encounter upon reaching the afterworld"
369,"Puberty Quest. After a number of years of preparation, the youth at age ten, eleven, or later, made the fast for a vision. For a few days the parents or grandparents provided only a little supper; then they constructed a small lodge or chose a place away from the main camp in a secluded spot. They marked the child's face with charcoal to warn other Ojibwas that the youth was fasting and not to offer food. The charcoal also served to make the youth look “pitiful,” a desired condition. They gave the youth no food for five days, then a little, then none. Between the sixth and tenth days the youth was expected to have the vision. The longer the youth waited, the stronger the vision. It was thought proper to refuse the first few visions offered, to seek the strongest vision possible. The youth was not encouraged to fast beyond the tenth day; if the faster insisted, some food would be provided on the tenth day and on every fifth day thereafter, until the vision came. Patients undertook the puberty quest for various reasons including; faster hunting success, good health, and old age"
370,"Mitewie or Midewiwin (Grand Medicine) ceremony, a spacious lodge is prepared in which several long poles are suspended in the manner of a scaffold, on which the different presents are exposed to view. All the members, dressed and painted as on all great occasions, go to this lodge in procession and preceded by drums, and, rattles. They take their seats indiscriminately on each side of the lodge, the men on one side, and the women on the other. The oldest and most considerable men generally begin the ceremony by singing and beating the drum. After beating the drum for a considerable time, one of the fraternity gets up and gently dances right opposite the music, and, by degrees, a whole group of dancers join, keeping exact time with the drum and, when heartily tired, quietly sit down in their places and smoke their pipes, without observing any particular ceremony. After breathing a little, the drummers summon up the dancers again, and the new members are allowed to join the dance. every major Grand Medicine ceremony the leaders recited the traditional Creation Myth, recounting the heroic deeds of Nanabozho and recalling his victories over the powers of the universe. This continues for the greater part of the day, until the conclusion of the ceremony when a smoking match takes place and silience prevails over the lodge. One of the members getting up, holding his medecine bag in a horizontal position before him and at the same time running with a short quick step round the lodge, articulating unintelligible sounds as he proceeds. After parading two or three times around in this manner, he shakes his bag with great dexterity, makes a push with it towards one of the members and immediately retires to his seat. The person pointed at pretends to be affected in an extraordinary manner; he groans, inclines his head in a languishing manner on his breast, or falls prostrate on the earth; he sometimes, indeed, contents himself with a little jerk backwards of the head, but always muttering something to himself, expressing his gratitude to the person who gave him the pretended shock. The same cheat is carried on until every member present has acted his part, and the newly adopted member properly instructed in the mystery."
371,"Shaking Tent ceremony, the officiant, the djessakid encourages the manito to enter the tent. Inside the audience sat around outside, throwing tobacco offerings into a small fire. The smoke blew the Indians' devotion upward to the manitos. After a while the manitos arrived, each making distinctive sounds. The Turtle, his assistants, the Four Winds and others flew in the top of the tent, causing it to shake violently. These were persons, not abstract powers. They possessed life, vitality, and personalities which distinguished them from one another. The people addressed the manitos, asking questions and seeking advice. The voices of the manitos responded, offering remedies, prescribing actions, and telling secrets. If the Indians needed information about a distant place, or if the souls of the dead or witches were required, the Turtle or his assistants made the errands while the djessakid sang about the manitos. Throughout a typical ceremony an audience bantered with the manitos, particularly with the Turtle. The people sitting around the tent called out for him to speak and engaged in a witty, often ribald, repartee with him. At one ceremony witnessed by Hallowell (1942: 44–50), the Ojibwa audience joked with the Turtle about his slowness afoot. When he returned from his errands, he told the Indians that he had not really gone anywhere, but had hidden himself behind the poles inside the tent. At the end of the rite he refused to leave the tent until forced out by the conjuring master. The Turtle had a distinctive voice (something like Donald Duck's) and appeared at every ceremony, so that the people felt comfortable and familiar with him. They passed tobacco into the tent for him to smoke; he joked about the quality of the offerings while sucking on his pipe with long whistling inhalations. Sometimes the conjurer performed special tricks of his own to show the power and presence of the manitos. He escaped from a knot of ropes or made the tent shake by simply placing an article of clothing inside it while he stood outside. These tricks tended to increase the reputation and prestige of the individual djessakid, but their primary role was to support the belief of the community in the manitos"
372,"The girls' menstruation rite was not strictly a religious act. The manitos were mentioned only briefly during the period of seclusion. Each girl stayed in an isolated hut, blackened her face, and avoided all males. Her powers during menstruation were said to interfere with hunting success. Prohibited from touching her body with her hands, she carried a scratching stick. Her eating and drinking utensils could not be used by any other person"
373,"Healing ritual. When summoned to attend a patient, the doctor painted himself in style and put on a kelp-goose down diadem. After an examination of the sufferer he informed the relatives of the nature of the illness and who had inflicted it. Next the sick man was stripped and seated on a guanaco-skin. Around him for some time walked the shaman, chanting incantations to break the spell of the disease. Then grasping his patient the doctor violently massaged the affected part. Finally the point of pain was lustily sucked, and then the shaman vomited forth the ostensible cause of the disorder--an arrowpoint, a pebble, a bit of wood, or some such object. If a cure could not be wrought at once, then this process was repeated at the discretion of the physician. While at times it must have caused great pain to the sufferer, yet it is undoubtedly true that cures were effected"
374,"Procedure at girls first mentruation. During these five to six days the girl may not leave her parental hut, must forgo entertainment and play, and practice absolute silence. Motionless and silent, she squats by the fire and waits out her time. There is no lack of variety, for neighbor women come in an almost uninterrupted procession and bring their instructions. The relatives at this time develop a striking zeal. That is, ancient custom wishes it thus: The girl must not remain alone. On the first day she is not permitted to eat at all, and drinking water is also reduced to a small measure. On the second day she is given small amounts of mushrooms or fish. It is not until the third day that a beginning is made with some firm meat. From the fourth day on the desired amount of meat is again permitted. On the very first day the required facial painting is drawn on the girl by the mother or a neighbor woman: Fine white lines, directed slightly ray-shaped, are led in a slight curve below the eyes and over the cheeks. These are renewed every morning of the five days. The girl is taught to take up the menstrual blood with a wad of wool and inconspicuously shove it into the deep glow of the hut fire is a custom among the women, with which the girl is now made familiar."
375,"Anyone who still wanted to eat something late in the evening, whether man or woman -- children are given nothing more late at night --, was obliged to throw a small piece of meat , raw or roasted, outside the hut; a short distance was sufficient. Turning his thoughts to T[unknown] má[unknown] kel , often without speaking his name, he would say softly: “I am going to eat now. This here is for ‘You-up-there’: Be good to us!” Although they expressly emphasize that their god does not eat, this fixed formula is retained. This had to be done so that the person in question “would not feel stomach pains during the night!” The next morning, they say further, that piece of meat is no longer to be found; the CPS causes it to disappear, although he himself does not eat. But “the eater should remain aware of the fact that ‘The-one-up-there’ sees what every person down here is doing!”"
376,"It was the duty of the woman, toward morning or in the evening, to throw out of the hut a little piece of glowing charcoal seized with the fire tongs. She said during this: “This is for ‘You-up-there’: Be good to us and give us fine weather!”. It was not denied that a man does not practice this sacrificial custom, but he seems to have lent himself to it only rarely. This sacrifice is supposed to be made twice a month on the average; but, in addition, it was also done during persistent bad weather, on stormy days, and if there has been a long snowfall"
377,"The Great Hut is erected in a remote meadow. The men assemble and the candidates are called. A special howl marks the beginning of the Kloketen celebration, this is repeated 3 times at intervals of three minutes. The guides collect the candidates. Women begin a monotonous song. Each guide removed the clothing of his candidate. Completely naked, the latter stretched his arms almost vertically upwards and over his head; he grasped a trunk of the inner wall with each hand, in order to stand firm during the washing. Without waiting until the skin had become dry, the guides mixed red colored-earth with water and a little guanaco fat. With that they smeared their whole bodies, usually in such a way that they put their flat hands on the neck or shoulders and moved them downward in straight strokes. The whole group proceeds towards the Great Hut, at a certain point the women must come no further and a cry is thrown up. Men waiting silently inside the hut begin howling on entrance of the candidates. Candidates are told to look up; there is a sudden appearance of ‘spirits’, who are specially painted and unrecognisable. A rigid terror flashed through the candidates, timidly they glanced down somewhat. The spirit with his two arms grasped the knees of the lad, pressed him close to him, shook him, lifted him up and set him down again. Up to now each candidate had pressed his arms tightly to his sides. Now the men ordered them to put their hands, with fingers interlocked, on their heads, with laterally directed elbows. The spirit started drawing short currents of air through nose and mouth, as though panting with lust; at the same time he put his upper body into writhing, tugging motions, twisted and nodded his head. For two minutes he thus showed his sensuality. With a sudden grip he seized the genitals of the boy, squeezed them tightly, so that it must have been painful, and intensified his panting. Then he played with them and tugged at them for 15 minutes. While the men found satisfaction in such proceedings, the boys were not spared considerable pain; they kept their hands folded over their heads in any case. The spirit concluded his play with a particularly violent, shaking tug at the genitals, which he had seized with both hands; at the same time he expelled a shrill-sounding current of air. After a short pause the candidates, although already tired, have a wrestle the spirit. This can be a painful ordeal, with the spirit squeezing the genitalia of the candidate and biting his thighs. The other men, shout and hoot at the candidate, intimidating him. The wrestling lasted for 30 minutes. The candidate is then made to remove the mask of the spirit, he does so fearfully, and is shocked to find that beneath it is a man he knows. The candidate is wrapped in a fur coat and can rest for a while. The candidates are given a scratching stick and must stand in a special body position what he must maintain constantly. An explanation of the events is given to the candidates and they are forbidden from telling women and children. An indefinite period of tuition (between a month and a year) now commences and men are trained in self-reliance."
378,"One easily recognizes as the main purpose of the P[unknown][unknown] ére , (or as it is referred to by Gusinde, the solemn assembly) is the gathering of many medicine men. But this is combined with the subsidiary purpose of gaining new callings for the office of medicine man. In short, nights of dancing and performance by medicine men are ended with a gift giving session. On the first day there is a long period at silent squatting, which end when one officiant begins with the customary singing, in which, sooner or later, his companions join. Sometimes the rest of the men also later take part. Now dancing and singing constantly alternate until morning, when the participants retire to bed. On the second night the men formed a closed ring around the fire area in the center. Within this ring, a little in front of some one man or another, the three officiants squatted a little distance apart. For a long time silent motionlessness had prevailed. officiants in particular showed the most strained concentration, and each of them appeared intense, he fixedly directed his eyes straight before him on the ground, without blinking an eyelash. Finally Tenenesk started the singing with a very soft voice; his lips scarcely moved, and for a long time he kept his eyes closed. It was a hollow-sounding, constantly repeated. Gradually the volume of the voice increased, sometimes became loud on the accents, and produced for all the participants an irritated sensitiveness of the nerves. Officant 1 rose. He kept his eyes, which shone glassily, always fixedly directed toward the ground. He put his right foot, stamping, a few centimeters forward on the ground, lifted it into the air a little, only to kick it immediately several times in rapid succession. In the manner given he now stepped forward , dragging his left foot behind, only to fall into a backward movement later, until he had reached his old standing place. He had only moved about one and a half meters from it. The song never stopped, the volume sometimes increased very much. From now on the old man showed still more inner agitation. As before, he moved a very short stretch forward and backward, stamping with the right foot and repeating the same melody. Having returned to his original seat and without letting a pause set in, he lay down stretched out on the ground, resting on his left side and his face turned toward the fire. He had drawn his cloak tight. He lay crosswise, like a cylinder, in front of the men squatting there. He changed the previous singing to a soft, continuous grunting, in that he drew in the air jerkily. At the same time he moved toward the fire by rolling turnings around his own body axis, and, to be sure, as far forward as the heat permitted. Without delay, he slowly rolled back to the starting point. The space available to him amounted at most to two meters, so that he could turn on his own axis only about three times. Four times he deliberately rolled back and forth, constantly grunting. At the same time he shifted somewhat to one side, with short steps and stamping the ground, placing his right foot forward and drawing the left one after it, exactly as before, only to return once more with reversed movements. With agitated intensification of the singing, he slightly opened the previously tightly drawn cloak and shook it so violently that it rustled noticeably, that is, in such a way that he lifted the free edge, held with his right hand, off his body in an arc and put into undulating motion this part of the cloak standing out. The other 2 officiants repeat the actions of officiant 1.During these lengthy proceedings the aroused agitation of all 3 officiants had inevitably been transferred to all the participants , who, for their part, followed their movements with mental tension. Many a man, almost unconsciously and with a very faint voice, joined in their song. Officiant 1 begins stamping on the ground again, he circled the fire four times. His bearing was slightly stooped and his glance directed firmly at the ground. He continuously rustled his cloak. Suddenly he collapsed, as it were, very close in front of me and struck the ground , sitting , so that I had to spread my outstretched legs lying on the ground, and he came to sit with his back pushed up very close to my chest. He firmly kept his face and his legs turned straight to the fire. Slowly sliding forward toward the fire, he bent his upper body backwards more and more, constantly leaning against the front of my body. Finally he had pushed himself forward so far that only his head rested on my abdomen. His breathing changed more and more to an actual groan. In such an extended body position he drew his cloak aside somewhat so that his abdomen became visible to all present; meanwhile he himself kept his eyes closed. During his deep, groaning breathing, his abdomen gradually swelled, which had all the greater effect since he lay almost flat on his back on the ground. One saw that drum-shaped, taut roundness and had the impression that large quantities of air had been squeezed into the abdominal cavity. The groaning had gradually subsided, and one did not see that he was still breathing. Gently he tapped himself on his drum-belly, which sounded very hollow. In between, he reached back with his right hand and also softly tapped me on the abdomen, for I was, of course, sitting quite close behind him. Soon after that his whole body fell into short, rapid swingings and these trembling motions imparted themselves also to my whole body. Only after about 20 minutes did this trembling subside and cease altogether. Immediately he pulled up his legs again and, sliding, he raised himself back into a sitting position, but in such a way that he was still leaning close against me. Suddenly he got up, became very lively, immediately leaped into the air repeatedly on the same spot, and, in an undertone, he cried out very anxiously. Following that he again circled the fire several times, and, with a violent shaking of his cloak, he stamped on the ground hard, amidst loud cries. Without granting himself a pause for rest, he started the same ceremony over again, in that he now placed himself between the outspread legs of his son. The customary song was carried on without interruption by the other two [unknown][unknown]n. The unceasing singing had also suggestively aroused the other men. At a sign from Tenenesk all rose and, moving close to one another, arranged themselves in a closed circle, each one encircling the neck of his two neighbors with his arms. All had removed their clothing. At once a quick dance around the fire began: With short steps and jumping, they turned for a long time first in one direction, then suddenly changing to the opposite direction; in the same rhythm as the jumps they uttered the [unknown]uk[unknown] úk,[unknown] uk[unknown] úk sounds. The officiants also took part in this rapid whirl, which lasted until some of them felt dizzy. After that, as though exhausted, each sank down at his sitting place. Some 20 minutes of complete motionlessness may have gone by, then Tenenesk shook himself as though he suddenly had been startled out of his dream-consciousness, and, positively astonished, he surveyed all those present from his squatting position. Pause for food and ceremony builds as before with low singing becoming loud and agitated, although the+E380 possession sequence does not occur again. This ends with whirling dancing around the fire until exhaustion. This soulkilling song is sung, this went on for over half an hour, until one after the other ceased and once more complete silence reigned in the great hut. On the next day the action is repeated, with one addition. Officiant 1 immediately made the rounds, behind this circle formed by the standing men, through the section of women and children pushed back somewhat. Here he pulled out several boys from 10 to 15 years old, by grasping them by one arm with both his hands and silently drawing them up. He thus led one boy after another into the circle of men. After completing his selection, he himself moved back into this circle. Now each one put his arms around the neck of his two neighbors. In a rapid whirl the turning around the fire began. After several rounds clear exhaustion appeared for many a boy. Paying no heed, the closed circle of men dragged them along without stopping, so that sporadically they were pulled along rather than being able to stride themselves. Only after many rounds was a halt made. The exhausted boys now had to remain seated in the circle of men. They were given ten minutes to recuperate. At the request of the three [unknown][unknown]n , the youths got up again. Since there were only eight of them, too small a number to make another circle around the fire, four younger men joined them. Again the whirling dance began. At the beginning, some boys still behaved somewhat awkwardly, but they soon achieved somewhat more agility and turned about rapidly in rhythmical uniformity. Their doings aroused much merriment among all present. The boys then perform a dance without the men. There is a strict silience for 20 minutes before a song begins. The men dance again. On the fifth day too this affair took the previous course, except that considerably stronger emotion and gesturing were displayed. Old Tenenesk's behavior resembled that of a mad man; he thrashed about menacingly, his song passed over into loud wailing and a groaning weeping. If such scenes were repeated for several days, a younger man of sensitive disposition would have to be carried along involuntarily, and he would finally behave in similar fashion. “The P[unknown][unknown] ére has seized him!”. The conclusion of this festival is a gift giving ritual, where objects are thrown at the chest or over the head of the intended recipient. Once received both parties stand in front of each other and laugh. Gifts are exchanged repeatedly; a received gift is likely to be passed to another recipient. . The surrender of even the most necessary articles, such as sandals, firestones, knives, etc., goes as far as total self-deprivation . A young man even threw his only cloak to his neighbor because he literally had nothing left; for a long time he had to walk about naked."
379,"Ritual to bring good weather, When bad weather, a snowfall or a rain storm, is threatening to begin or become worse, the counsellor orders that the chowh-toxen (‘water-cease’) rite be performed. In the Hain a number of young men (there were eight in 1923) wind pads of dry grass around their heads to form a crown. They leave the Hain naked in a row, chanting wa wa wa, and dance to the centre of the stage, where a fire is either smouldering or entirely extinguished. They rotate about the embers and then move in a line to a nearby source of water. Arms entwined, they circle the source facing inwards and chanting sh sh sh while rotating faster and faster, alternately clockwise and anti-clockwise. At some time during the scene, the older women begin chanting yó shu xe é yó. Meanwhile, the girls gleefully throw leather buckets full of water, often mixed with snow and ice, on the backs of the men. Sometimes they throw snow balls. When the girls tire of this the men join hands and dance in a line back to the Hain. The rite may be repeated several times during a day and on subsequent days until the weather does improve."
380,"The sham Hain, on the first day of the Kloketen, while the initiates are being subjected to the terrors of the rite of passage, the women, left alone in the camp with the children, are not necessarily idle. Some are busy ‘having fun’. A group of women go a short distance from the camp in the opposite direction from the Hain. They are naked to the waist and as it is the first day of the Hain they are painted with the tari of their respective skies. Their faces are either covered with charcoal or painted white. All wear the men's head band, the kochil. One of the kloketen mothers pretends to be Shoort while another plays the role of a kloketen. They wrestle with each other in imitation of the rite of passage, while the rest of the women stand about and bait them. One of the bystanders shouts at the ‘kloketen’: ‘Grab him! Grab him! Don't let him throw you down! She-un! She-un! Mata mae kisé! Almost any day during the ceremony and especially after Shoort had made a particularly ominous visit, he might be caricatured by a woman who would stride through the camp stabbing the women who had remained in the huts with a stick or lambasting them with a basket, just as Shoort was in the habit of doing. The women would laugh until they could bear it no longer. Finally, the female Shoort would take her leave, flexing her biceps in the proper manner. These games were played, as Angela said, ‘while the men were busy in the Hain’."
381,"The first ceremony – throwing up the boy; ‘Alkirakiwuma’ The men, and women, assemble at a spot near to the main camp and the boys who have reached the right age are taken one by one and tossed in the àir several times by the men who catch them as they fall while the women dance round and round swinging their arms about and shouting ‘pow’ ‘pow’ ‘powa-a-a,’ the last cry being very prolonged. The boys are painted with a design and are told that the ceremony through which they have just passed will promote their future growth to manhood, and they are told by tribal fathers and elder brothers that in future they must not play with the women and girls, nor must they camp as they have hitherto done with them but must henceforth go to the camp of the younger and unmarried men which is know as the ‘Ungunja.’ Up to this time they have been accustomed to go out with the women as they searched for vegetable food and the smaller animals such as lizards and rats, now they begin to accompany the men in their search for larger game. Very shortly after this the boy has his nasal septum bored, but this is not attended with any special ceremony."
382,"The second ceremony; Circumcision or Lartna. The boy (status: Ulpmerka) is woken from his bed and led to the camp of the men. Here there is dancing and singing, he is led through the throng, then isolated in the bush for an hour or so and then led back through. The patient is then secluded in the bush for 2 days, before he participates in a series of quabarra rituals which involve participants lying on top of him. The patient goes hunting with the men, and witnesses a ritual but does not participate. Some days later he is circumcised, bullroarers are pressed against the wounds. The patient’s status is now Arakurta, he stands by the fire and lets smoke pass over the wound."
383,"Quabarra, rituals that can only be witnessed by initated men occur repeatedly during initiation proceedsings. When the boy is told to look up he sees lying in front of him and on his side a decorated man, whom the Oknia and Okilia, both speaking at once, tell him represents a wild-dog. At the other end of the Apulla another decorated man stands with his legs stretched wide apart and holding twigs of eucalyptus in each hand; his head is decorated with a small ornament called a Waninga to which further reference will be made subsequently. The performer moves his head from side to side as if looking for something and every now and then utters a sound similar to that made by a kangaroo, which animal he represents. Suddenly the dog looks up, sees the kangaroo and begins to bark. Running along on all fours he passes between the legs of the kangaroo man who strikes him with the twigs, after which he lies down again for a minute or two behind the kangaroo who keeps watching him over his shoulder while he utters the sound. Then the dog gets up, runs from behind between the kangaroo's legs, is caught by the head, shaken, and howls as if in pain while a pretence is made of dashing his head upon the ground. This is repeated several times and finally the dog is supposed to be killed by the kangaroo. Then the dog runs quickly on all fours to the Wurtja and lies down on the top of him; he is at once followed by the kangaroo who hops on to the top of the dog and so the Wurtja has to bear the weight of both men for about two minutes. When they get up, the Wurtja, still lying down, is told by the old men that the quabarra represents an incident which took place in the Alcheringa when a wild dog man attacked a kangaroo man and was killed by the latter. The object which the kangaroo wore on his head was, he is told, a Waninga, a sacred object, the name of which must never be mentioned in the hearing of women or children, and that, in fact, it represents a kangaroo. When this is over the Wurtja is led back to his brake and the men continue singing at intervals nearly all night."
384,"After the circumcision ritual the patient is isolated, before sub-incision he has to undergo a painful rite called Koperta kakuma; head-biting. He is placed, lying face downwards, while men of all classes sit round, singing about the biting of the head of the Arakurta and urging the biters to bite deeply. The men who are to do the biting, and who may be of any class, and are usually from two to five in number, are chosen, on each occasion on which the operation is performed, by the oldest Kullia of the Arakuria. Their duty is to bite the scalp as hard as they can, until blood flows freely, the patient often howling with pain. Each man may content himself with one bite, or he may bite two or even three times. The object of this really painful operation is, so they say, to make the hair grow strongly, and at times the chin may be bitten as well as the scalp. The sub-incision operation which is performed with a stone knife only occupies a very short time, and consists, in slitting the penile urethra. Patients are then taken to one side and the blood which flows from their wounds is allowed to drain into shields on which they squat. They are now no longer Arakurta but Ertwakurka or initiated men. When the Arakurta is seized for the purpose of having the rite of Ariltha performed on him the men set up a loud and prolonged shout of ‘pirr-rr’ which can be heard by the women at the camp. They at once assemble at the Erlukwirra, that is the women's camp, and the Mia of the boy cuts the Unchalkulkna woman across the stomach and shoulders and then makes similar cuts upon women who are the boy's mura, elder and younger sisters, as well as upon those who are her own elder sisters. While making the cuts she imitates the sound made by the Ariltha party. These particular cuts which usually leave a definite series of cicatrices. It very often happens that as soon as the operation on an Arakurta has been performed one or more of the younger men present, but who have been operated on before, stand up and voluntarily undergo a second ariltha operation. In such cases the men do not consider that the incision has been carried far enough. Standing out on the clear space upon which the Arakurta has been operated upon, with legs wide apart and hands behind this back, the man shouts out ‘Mura ariltha atnartinja yinga aritchika pitchi’ -- ‘Mura mine, come and cut my ariltha down to the root.’"
385,"After the lapse of twelve or eighteen months after interment the ceremony of Urpmilchimilla is performed at the grave. This ceremony occurs if deceased is male, see below for female. The meaning of this term is “trampling the twigs on the grave.” The women, on the appointed day, were assembled at the Lukwurra and paint the widow. When complete they utter their peculiar mournful wail. The lead was taken by the widow, who was carrying the Chimurilli in a wooden pitchi. They came on until the spot was reached at which the Gammona were seated, and approached in such a way as to come up behind the latter. Then, standing behind each man, the widow thrust the pitchi under the arms and on to the lap of each one in turn. There it was allowed to remain, held by the man for some minutes, the women crying loudly and the men with bent heads shedding tears, but uttering no sound. A visit was first paid to the camp where the man died, and, dancing round the charred remains (when a native dies his camp is at once destroyed by fire), they all shouted, “ Wha! wha! wha! wha-a-a! ” the men as they did so beating the air with their spear-throwers, which were grasped in the centre instead of at one end, and held with their hollow side outwards. Those women who were Mia, Uwinna, and Mura of the dead man did not join in the shouting, or make any movement with the arms, but wailed loudly and threw themselves on to the ground. When the dancing, which lasted about ten minutes, was over, the whole party proceeded to the grave at a run, the leader making a circuit away from the main party, shouting loudly with very prolonged intonation. The idea is that the spirit is frightened when he hears the noise and sees the widow coming on wearing the Chimurillia, and, being driven on, takes refuge at the bottom of the grave. The main party went on shouting in suppressed tones, “ Wha! wha! ” the men keeping time by beating the air with their spear-throwers. The leader, who had been running more rapidly than the rest, arrived at the grave just before the others, and with a final and much-prolonged “Ba-au!” jumped on to the grave into which the spirit was supposed to have fled and began dancing wildly. He was quickly followed by the others, all of whom, except the Mia, Uwinna, and Mura women, who lay down on the ground close by, began to dance backwards and forwards on and around the grave shouting, “ Wha! wha! ” and beating the air downwards as if to drive the spirit down, while with their feet they stamped upon and broke the twigs with which a newly-made grave is always covered. When these were thoroughly broken up the dancing ceased, the men separated from the women and went to one side, while the widow and other women cleared up the débris, which was carried a little distance away from the grave, immediately around which a space was cleared for a few yards. When this had been done, the Mia, Uwinna, and Mura women, who had meanwhile been lying prostrate, wailing at the top of their voices, and now and again striking the ground with their bodies, got up and approached the grave. Gathered around this, they struck and cut their heads with fighting-clubs, inflicting on themselves often severe wounds, from which the blood flowed on to the grave. After a little time the cutting ceased and they moved away. The men stood solemnly on one side while the widow came forward with her sisters, blood and tribal, and scratched a hole in the top of the grave. When this was deep enough the widow and the younger woman took the Chimurillia off their heads and, while all the women cried loudly, tore them to pieces, and, kneeling over the grave, deposited the remains in the hole."
386,"In the case of the Urpmilchimilla of a woman the proceedings are somewhat different, All the women in the camp assembled at the Lukwurra shortly after sunrise. The actual mother of the deceased was painted deeply all over with pipeclay, the tribal Mias were painted with ochre. After about ten minutes had been spent in embracing one another, while a continuous wailing was kept up, a start was made for the grave. After going a short distance they were met by a man who was a blood brother of the dead woman, and was accompanied by a number of his tribal brothers. Everyone sat down and the lamenting again began. The Ungaraitcha, who carried the pitchi containing the Chimurillias, handed it to the brother, who bowed his head over it while he pressed it against his stomach for a minute or two, after which he removed one of the Chimurillias and placed it upon his mother's head. After it had been worn by the woman for a short time she replaced it in the pitchi, which was then taken by the Ungaraitcha and pressed against the stomach of each man in turn, the idea being to assuage their sorrow. The Chimurillias were then taken by the brother and placed on the heads of two tribal Ungaraitcha of the dead woman, and the party started for the grave. No man is allowed to attend the Urpmilchimilla of a woman. On the way to the grave the mother often threw herself heavily on the ground and attempted to cut her head with a digging-stick. Each time she did so she was picked up by two women, whose duty it appeared to be to prevent her from hurting herself too much; but by the time that the grave was reached her body was a mass of bruises and covered over with sharp, three-cornered prickles. At the grave she threw herself upon it, tearing up the earth with her hands and being literally danced upon by the other women. Then all the Mias and Uwinnas threw themselves on the grave, the Mias cutting and hitting each other about the body until they were streaming with blood. Each of them carried a digging-stick, which was used unsparingly on its owner's head and on those of the others, no one attempting to ward off the blows, which they even invited."
387,"When a girl is of marriageable age, she is taken out to the bush for a ritual operation called Aina-arilta-kum. The operation is conducted with a stone knife, and the operator, who is, except in the southern Arunta, a man who is Ipmunna to the girl, carries with him one of the small wooden Churinga called Namatwinna, with which, before operating, he touches the lips of the vulva, so as to prevent too great a loss of blood. When the operation has been performed, the Ipmunna, Unkulla and Anua have access to her in the order named. This ceremony is often performed during the progress of an Altherta or ordinary corrobboree, when, during the day-time, the men habitually assemble at the corrobboree ground. When it is over, the woman's head is decorated, by the Ipmunna man who operated, with head bands and tufts of Alpit. the neck with necklaces, the arms with bands of fur string, and her body is painted all over with a mixture of fat and red ochre. Thus decorated, she is taken to the camp of her special Anua by the men who have taken part in the ceremony, and who have meanwhile painted themselves with charcoal."
388,"To promote the growth of the breasts of a girl, the men assemble at the Ungunja, or men's camp, where they all join in singing long chants, the words of which express an exhortation to the breasts to grow, and others which have the effect of charming some fat and red ochre, which men who are Gammona --that is, brothers of her mother--have brought to the spot, as well as head and arm bands of fur-string. At daylight one of them goes out and calls her to a spot close to the Ungunja, to which she comes, accompanied by her mother. Here her body is rubbed all over with fat by the Gammona men, who then paint a series of straight lines of red ochre down her back and also down the centre of her chest and stomach. A wide circle is painted round each nipple and straight lines below each of these circles. Long strings of opossum fur-string are passed across each shoulder and under each arm-pit; numbers of neck-rings are put round her neck, several head-rings are placed on her forehead, and a number of tail tips are fixed so that they droop down over the forehead and ears. All these things have been charmed by the Gammona singing over them. When this has been done, the girl is taken out into the bush by her mother, who makes a camp there at some distance from the main one, and here the girl must stay until the ilkinia or lines on her body wear off"
389,"In the Arunta and Ilpirra tribes a girl at the first time of menstruation is taken by her mother to a spot close to, but apart from, the Lukwurra or women's camp, near to which no man ever goes. A fire is made and a camp formed by the mother, the girl being told to dig a hole about a foot or eighteen inches deep, over which she sits, attended by her own and some other tribal Mia, who provide her with food, one or other of them being always with her, and sleeping by her side at night-time. No children of either sex are allowed to go near to her or to speak to her. During the first two days she is supposed to sit over the hole without stirring away; after that she may be taken out by one or other of the old women hunting for food. When the flow ceases she is told to fill in the hole."
390,"Molimo, dance of death ritual, is performed primarily by men and is associated with singing and the use of a particular type of horn, called the Molimo horn. The Molimo is particularly associated with death, but it may be performed at any crisis, such as a poor hunting season. Singing occurs for a number of nights. Then one night a group of boys comes running into the village with long branches, fighting imaginary foes and damaging huts with them. Trumpets sound. After the molimo has left the men come out of the houses and sing loudly. The Molimo fire was fanned up into a blaze, and youths ran swiftly around the camp picking up bits of wood from everywhere, dancing back to the kumamolimo and throwing them onto the fire. Then, with a wild rush, the two trumpets joined together and were surrounded by a single dancing forest, and sounding a martial air they tramped around the edge of the fire and disappeared into the trees. They seemed to cross the river and climb up the hill on the far side, until the sound of our own voices drowned the more distant music of the trumpets. The girls that had been in Kondabate's hut came out as soon as we started. They had painted their bodies with black kangay juice, and in their hair they had twined circlets of vine, one strand of which stuck way out in front, over their foreheads, with a small bunch of feathers dangling from the end. They kept together in a tight little group, their bodies swaying in unison to the songs of the men. Then they began to dance, still so close together that I could not see between them. They danced all around the group, forcing us closer and closer to the fire. In a snaking, graceful line they seemed to take charge of the music, increasing the tempo until the men were as exhausted as they were, and we all stopped for a rest. After a while the men started singing again, but gently, and then with a shock I realized that the women were singing as well, the sacred songs of the molimo. And they were not just joining in, they were leading the singing. Songs that I had thought only the men knew and were allowed to sing--all of a sudden the women were showing that they not only knew them but could sing them with just as much intensity. Moke spoke--I am not sure whether it was for my benefit or because it was his place to say what he did. He said, “This woman has tied us up. She has bound the men, bound the hunt, and bound the molimo. We can do nothing.” Then Manyalibo said that we had to admit we had been bound, and that we should give the woman something as a token of our defeat; then she would let us go. A certain quantity of food and cigarettes was agreed upon, and the old woman solemnly went among us again, untying each man. Nobody attempted to loose himself, but as each man was untied he began to sing once more--the molimo was free. The old woman received her gifts and went back to Cephu's camp, where she and her husband were staying. The couple stayed for another week or two, but she danced only once again. Before she left us she went to every man, giving him her hand to touch as though it were some kind of blessing. It was not long after this that everyone started talking about when they should bring the molimo to an end. There seemed to be no specific length of time that it should run, and it was just a question of convenience"
391,"An elima, or the dance of life, is a celebration that takes place when a girl reaches maturity, as marked by the first appearance of menstrual blood. In the house of the elima the are taught the arts and crafts of motherhood by an old and respected relative. They learn not only how to live like adults, but how to sing the songs of adult women. Pygmies from all around come to pay their respects, the young men standing or sitting about outside the elima house in the hopes of a glimpse of the young beauties inside. And there are special elima songs which they sing to one another, the girls singing a light, cascading melody in intricate harmony, the men replying with a rich, vital chorus. For the Pygmies the elima is one of the happiest, most joyful occasions in their lives. The girls had already learned most of their songs, and they were now at the stage where they were taking a more active, even an aggressive interest in the eligible bachelors of the neighborhood. I the evenings when they stood up to dance they often made it very clear by their gestures which boy had taken their fancy. Armed with whips the girls lashed young and old men, if they whip a bachelor he is obliged to visit the girl in the elimo house. The girls march to another pygmy camp, singing loudly. The whole of the camp was awake before the rest of the girls had had time to whip more than a few boys, and it soon became alive with lashing whips and flying sticks and stones. The women and children crept into the backs of their huts for shelter, while the men ran from rubbish dump to rubbish dump, gathering the banana skins they used as ammunition. When they could not find any, they used whatever came to hand. A slice of banana skin fired from a taut bow at close quarters can be quite painful, and the girls found that the boys were putting up a good fight. So they picked up a few vine baskets that had been left lying around, and using these as shields they advanced on their quarry. The fight got more and more fierce, and at one time the boys managed to drive the girls right back into the huts. Then they stood at the entrances and fired their pellets of banana skin inside, giving rise to squeals of anguish. But Kidaya was too tough to be done down so easily. She emerged from her shelter without even a basket for protection, and made a dash for the nearest fire. As she bent down to pick up a burning log, her particular boy friend fired a pellet that struck her on her buttocks with a smack. Kidaya spun around and hurled the log with all her might; then she rubbed her back side affectionately and smiled. The other girls also began throwing logs, and soon there was hardly a fire left in the camp. The girls sang all the way home; even when they left the forest and made their way back across the Epulu, gleaming orange and gold in the late afternoon light, they sang. On another evening the girls present themselves, their bodies decorated with modest blobs of white paste made from clay. They must have spent hours working on themselves and one another, for they were covered with elaborate patterns skillfully drawn with fingers and thin sticks, also using the white clay. They began singing then, together with the women, much more seriously than they had ever done before. They sang songs whose words had no particular significance, but which in themselves were of the greatest significance, being songs sung only by adult women. In the last week of the elima, the boy has to show considerable courage to fight his way into the house, after he has been invited. In the last week the women maintain constant guard outside, and they are well supplied with all sorts of ammunition. If they want to keep any particular boy away from their daughters they are perfectly capable of doing it. And when a boy finally succeeds in breaking his way through he still has to face a possible beating from the girls inside. If he has not been invited by having been beaten beforehand, he will certainly have to go through it now. On a Sunday morning they oiled their bodies and donned oily new bark cloths and returned to dance in the village. They danced in a tight little circle while the women cooked the food. The villagers came to watch approvingly and to see that the food was properly distributed, for only certain people may eat it. They also made sure that all the leaves which had been used as a sleeping mattress in the elima house were thrown away and the house cleaned thoroughly. In this way they satisfied themselves that no harm would come to “their” Pygmies. The ancestors would be appeased by the feast, and the evil spirit that hovered around the unclean girls would be driven away."
392,"Boys initiation, nkumbi. The villagers hoped that the nkumbi would place the Pygmies directly under the supernatural authority of the village tribal ancestors. Village boys are circumcised with a pygmy boy next to them, who is circumcised in turn (the village and pygmy boy are now in a blood bond called karé). Circumcised participants are then made to dance. The boys are subjected to mild torture and psychological humiliation for 2-3 months; for instance receiving beatings with notched sticks or being made to obscenely imitate ones father. They are subject to taboos. To get wet, particularly by being outside when it rained, was sure to bring death. To eat certain foods was strictly prohibited. The boys had to eat without using their hands directly, spearing the food with sticks. They were forbidden to eat with their initiated relatives. The sound of the bull-roarer, a piece of wood that makes a strange whirring noise when spun around on the end of a cord, was meant to be the voice of a forest demon, and the boys had to show due respect and terror when they heard it."
393,"An important sacrifice is made for the re-opening of the forest (abo lese or sulia). Continuously bad hunting may be attributed to the anger of the God of the Undergrowth. Under the circumstances all the weapons in the camp are brought out and placed in a pile in the center of the clearing. The hunters stand around in a circle, each with an arm held over the weapons. The transgressor, who had divided game he had caught without waiting for the elder, brandished a live chicken over the center of the circle praying for success in the hunt. In the invocation he mentioned Bali (local name for the God of the Undergrowth), “fathers,” “grandfathers,” and the name of his own father who had apparently been an outstanding hunter. Then the elder cut off the head of the chicken, sprinkled blood on the weapons and the arms of the hunters, and threw the fluttering carcass onto the ground. Everyone watched which way it moved, and when it finally fell with the stump of its neck pointing toward the forest, this was taken as a good omen and there was a shout of joy. The wife of the elder then took the carcass and invoked Bali and the ancestors, asking them to give their children game again. The dead chicken was then given to a woman married into another band who, together with her children, ate it. This woman's son, a nephew of the band concerned, built a small hut ( sa'a ) near the elder's hut, and placed in it the heart and liver of the chicken; the head was stuck on a stake above. The elder made an invocation for game to both Bali and the befe (sprites)."
394,"Invocations usually concern the weather (requests for a storm to pass over speedily or to be diverted) and are often accompanied by the blowing of the segbe magic pipe, indicating with the arm the direction the storm should take. The archers also may light a special fire and cover it with leaves so that a thick smoke rises. The God of the Undergrowth sees the smoke, smells its fragrance, and hears the segbe pipes. His attention is thus drawn to the plight of his “children.”"
395,"All Mbuti are said by Schebesta to offer a portion of food to the God of the Undergrowth. We can take this to apply to the archers. The practice seems to concern only food that has been hunted or gathered--game, honey, and vegetable products. The offering, never made with great fervor, may simply be thrown into the undergrowth, either in silence or with a brief comment such as “ Mugu! daó a iye! ” (“ Mugu! This is for you!”). Alternatively, it may be placed on a leaf and taken with care into the forest and put in the fork of a tree, with or without an invocation. Stakes may be used, driven into the ground, forked into three or more branches at the upper end. Clay pots (obtained from villagers) or potsherds are placed in these forks for the offerings. Holes in the sides of trees are also used as a depository for offerings. The Mbuti do not usually use special shrines or spirit huts."
396,"The first of the annual cycle of village festivals was called Denbilsia and was observed after the completion of the clearing of the new swiddens, generally in January to February Denbilsia was a one-day festival and was held at the nokma’ s house. During the morning of the festival day, all the people gathered in front of the nokma’ s house, where a bamboo altar was set up. Around noon, the nokma sacrificed a pig or a goat at this altar. After the sacrifice, the animal’s flesh was cut up and cooked, along with other foodstuffs, such as rice, fish, and other kinds of meat, and these were offered to all the villagers at a feast sponsored by the nokma. The nokma would also provide liberal amounts of rice-beer which the villagers drank all day long. After the feast, in the afternoon, the people would dance, sing and make music, activities which were continued until about midnight, when the villagers would return home to sleep."
397,"The second festival, Agalmaka, was observed after the swiddens had been fired. The festival began with the nokma sacrificing a cock in his own swidden, after which the head of every household in the village would offer an egg, each in his own field. Although the sacrifice and offerings were accomplished in a single morning, the festival itself lasted for several days. On the first day the nokma sponsored a feast for his villagers. After eating and drinking, the people would make music, dance and sing at the nokma’ s house. On the following days people would visit each other’s houses, the arrangements for food, drink, dancing and singing being the responsibility of each individual household."
398,"Before seeds were sown in the swiddens, the Garo would observe the festival called Asiroka . On this occasion the nokma sacrificed a cock at a bamboo altar erected somewhere within the village itself. Following this sacrifice, the villagers would slaughter a cow, which they had purchased beforehand. This cow was not sacrificed to propitiate any mite, but simply killed for its flesh, which was distributed among the villagers according to the amount of money they had contributed for its purchase in the first place. After this distribution of meat, the villagers returned home to rest for the remainder of the day. The next day, each household head would sacrifice an animal (ox, pig, goat, or at least a cock, the kind of animal depending upon the household’s economic condition) in his own swidden. After the sacrifice the villagers would feast, dance and sing. But the following day was again set aside as a day of rest"
399,"Around June to July, when the padi was growing in the swiddens, the Garo would observe a festival called Miamua. This festival lasted only a single day and, during it, the nokma would sacrifice a pig in his own swidden and sponsor a feast for all the villagers. After the feast, which took place around noon, the people used to sing and play music. But they were forbidden on this occasion to beat drums. It was said that the beating of drums at this particular time could attract the attention of some malevolent mite."
400,"Before they harvested their swidden crops, the villagers would observe the festival called Rongchugala . This usually fell in August. On this occasion the nokma would offer the mite a special dish called rongchu, which is rice which has been cooked until dry and crisp. The rongchu was spread out on a banana leaf and kept in the nokma’ s house. After the nokma had made this traditional offering, there would be feasting, drinking and music-making. But, for the very same reason as at the Miamua festival, there would be no drumming or dancing on this occasion"
401,"After the harvest, in September, the Garo villagers observed the festival called Ahaia. On this occasion each household head would prepare a fish for the mite, the offering being made in the farmer’s own swidden. Then, for several days, there would be much feasting, drinking, dancing and music-making."
402,"The last festival of the annual cycle was Wangala and this was the greatest celebration of them all. It would be observed about a month after Ahaia, at a time when the Garo villagers were completely free from farm work, having brought in their harvest even before Ahaia . The Wangala festival would last for several days. The first day would find the villagers busy slaughtering cows, which they had purchased earlier for this purpose. These animals were killed solely for their meat, not as a sacrifice to the mite. Several households joined together to purchase an animal and would share the meat among themselves according to the amount of money they had contributed to the purchase price. It was essential for every household to have meat to offer their guests on this great festive occasion. On the second day of Wangala, the nokma made offerings to the mite inside his house. Known as churugala, this ceremony involved the pouring of some chu, or rice-beer, and the placing of other offerings (cooked rice, an onion, a root of ginger, and a squash), all set out on a banana leaf, at an especially sacred place known as the dinsam. This place could be located at any corner of the nokma’ s main sleeping room ( din ) and it was here that he kept the sacred drums, other musical instruments, his sword, shield, etc . After these offerings had been made, the villagers decorated the posts and beams of the nokma’ s house by making handprints on them with a paste of flour and water. Having thus decorated their leader’s house, the villagers helped each other decorate their own buildings in exactly the same fashion. Feasting, drinking, music-making and dancing lasted for several days. First, each household would visit the nokma’ s house, after which it would visit every other house in the village. At each establishment, the guests would be honoured with food and drink, music and dance."
403,"When a man or woman dies, the body is washed, with chu-b˘itchi or undiluted liquor if the deceased was a nokma or a rich man, or with water if he was poor. A pillow of loose, unginned cotton is placed under the head of the corpse. A young chicken is tethered to the big toe of either the right or left foot, with a sufficient length of string to allow it to walk about on the floor. a small basket filled with uncooked rice, is then placed close to the dead person’s head. On the rice an egg is placed, and round the egg, cock’s tail feathers are planted in the rice. A small basket of uncooked rice is then laid near the foot of the corpse for the chicken to eat. A pot of liquor is placed behind the head of the corpse, and lastly, the floor near the head is covered with pieces of plantain leaf, upon which have been heaped cooked rice and various kinds of animal food. The valuable property of the deceased’s household, such as ornaments and clothes, is then hung round about him as he lies in state. The corpse having been thus laid out, is allowed to remain for two days and a night, and is burned on the second night. During this period, watch is constantly kept by women, with whom is generally the kamal or priest. These keep up an almost unceasing dirge, which consists of a recital of the good deeds and qualities of the deceased, and of a prayer that his spirit may be guided safely to its appointed place. While this dirge is being sung, one of the singers beats in slow time on the floor with a piece of wood or the shuttle of a Garo loom, or uses a pair of small cymbals. In order that the watchers of the dead shall not go to sleep, the young men of the village dress up as wild beasts and come into the house of mourning to frighten the women with their howls and antics. These are represented in a very crude fashion, for the actors merely smear their faces with ashes or some other white substance, or wear masks made out of pieces of plantain stem. This pantomime is considered an important part of some funeral ceremonies. During the lying-in period, the kamal, who is a man well-versed in the funerary incantations and rituals, advises the soul how it may safely reach the land of the dead. The kamal recites this incantation many times, right up until the time that the corpse is cremated."
404,"On the day of the cremation, but before the corpse is removed, a preparatory ceremony, known as ja ‘ragata or the bringing home of the spirit, is performed. Among the Akawés it consists of the following. The relations of the dead go in procession from the house in which he died to that of his mother. When the distance is not too great, they lead a cotton string from one house to the other. I witnessed it once when the sister of a laskar died in a village not far from Garobadha. The woman’s own home was near Damalgiri, about eleven miles from where she died. The ja ‘ragata party marched to the spot where she had died and been burned, and back to her mother’s house. First went a man carrying on his back a large pot of liquor, an essential on such an occasion. Behind him came six or seven boys beating gongs, a man blowing a singa or buffalo-horn trumpet, and, last of all, another man beating a kram, or drum of the pattern used on solemn occasions."
405,"As for the disposal of the corpse, it is cremated on a pyre, known as a ganchi, which is built on any open space within the village area. First, four wooden posts are set up and wood and bamboo fuel piled up within the space so formed. Then, the corpse is placed atop this pyre. To one of the four funerary posts are tied some of the deceased’s clothing, a few of his or her agricultural implements, household utensils and ornaments, especially brass earrings. Responsibility for setting alight the funeral pyre rests with the kamal. And, when the last part of the body is about to be consumed by the flames, he must slaughter an animal. The purpose of this sacrifice is to release the soul of the slaughtered animal so that it may accompany the dead person’s soul to Chikmang. The flesh of the sacrificed beast is eaten by those who have worked to build the funeral pyre and others who have attended the ceremony."
406,"After the cremation, the deceased’s ashes are disposed of somewhere in the forest, but any bones which have survived the flames are gathered up and placed inside an earthenware jar which is then buried somewhere near the deceased’s house. At this burial place, a small bamboo platform, called a delang, is set up. The blood of the chicken sacrificed at the cremation is smeared on it and offerings of rice and curry relishes, the normal food of the living, are made to the soul of the deceased, at least once a day for the whole period from the cremation until the performance of the post-funerary ceremony."
407,"The post-funerary ceremony comprises a great feast, with dancing and singing, and lasts for two to three days. Sponsored by the dead person’s household, nobody has to receive a special invitation to attend the feast. The villagers are expected to come along, uninvited, and to join in the eating, singing and dancing. In the event of a really grand feast, villagers from other Garo communities will come along as well. The ceremony ends when all the food and drink prepared for the occasion has been consumed. In the evening of that final day, the delang is destroyed by fire and its ashes covered over with earth. I was told by some informants that one could determine what form of reincarnation the deceased’s soul would eventually take by observing the ground where the ashes of the delang had been covered with earth."
408,"Asongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village a number of stones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently without order or method. These are known by the name of asong, and on them is offered the sacrifice which the Asougtata demands. The sacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of a langur ( Entcllus monkey), or a bamboo-rat is considered necessary. The animal chosen has a rope fastened round its neck and is led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house in the village. It is taken inside each house in turn, the assembled villagers, meanwhile, beating the walls from the outside, to frighten and drive out any evil spirits which may have taken up their residence within. The round of the village having been made in this manner, the monkey or rat is led to the outskirts of the village, killed by a blow of a duo, which disembowels it, and then crucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round the crucified animal long, sharp bamboo stakes are placed, which form chcvaux de frisc round about it. Those commemorate the days when such defences surrounded the villages on all sides to keep off human enemies, and they are now a symbol to ward off sickness and dangers to life from the wild animals of the forest. The langur required for the purpose is hunted down some days before, but should it be found impossible to catch one, a brown monkey may take its place."
409,"In case of severe illness the denjaringa ceremony, is performed. Near the stream from which the invalid obtains his supply of water a place is cleared in the jungle, and on this open spot a sambasia is erected together with various bamboo receptacles for offerings of rice, cotton, etc. The officiating kamal or priest sacrifices a fowl, smears its blood as usual over the sambasia, and plasters the bamboos with the bird’s feathers. He then ties one end of a cotton thread to the sambasia, leads it to the sick man’s house and fastens the other end in the room in which he is lying. On the string a sprig of kimbal leaves is hung. The idea is that if the sick man’s spirit leaves his body it may be induced to return by the prayers of his friends, and will be able to find its way back by means of the thread as a guide. Outside the house the priest takes up his stand, and during the whole day calls upon Tatara-Rabuga to cure the sick person. A horn is blown continuously the while to frighten away the evil spirit which is afflicting the sick man. When night falls, if there has been no change in his condition, the priest addresses his prayers to the spirit Bidawé, who steals the souls of men, and continues his intercession as before. This having been kept up until a late hour, the cotton string is examined where the leaves were hung, and if it shows any sign of having sagged, it is believed that the sick man’s spirit has come back, and that he will recover. The string is then broken, and a piece of it tied round the neck of the invalid; drums and musical instruments strike up in his room, and his relations greatly rejoice. When I was told about this, I suggested that the last part of the performance was rather drastic treatment, and that it must often prove fatal to the patient; but I was told that, on the contrary, the moral effect of a belief that the gods had heard the prayers, cheered the patient and buoyed him up so greatly, that the pandemonium created by the musical instruments in so confined a space, did him no harm."
410,"After the rice harvest has been fully gathered in, the great sacrifice and festival of the year, the Wangala or Guréwata takes place. This is the most festive observance of the year, and combines religious sacrifice with much conviviality. The cost of the entertainment falls principally on the nokma of the village, who provides a pig to be eaten by his guests, and plenty of liquor. Among the Akawés and Chisaks of the north and north-eastern hills a curious feature of the ceremony is the manufacture of guré or “horses” out of pieces of plantain-stem for the body, and of bamboo for the head and legs. The image of the “horse” is laid on the floor of the nokma’s house, and the assembled guests dance and sing around it the whole night long, with the usual intervals for refreshments. Early the next morning, the “horse” is taken to the nearest river and launched on the water to find its way down stream on the current. For those who possess the necessary paraphernalia, the guré takes the shape of a horse’s head of large size, made of straw, and covered with cloth. The head is mounted on a stick, which a man holds before him in such a way that the head comes up to the level of his chest. Two straps pass over his shoulders to relieve his hands of the weight. The body of the “horse” is then built round his own body with cane and cloth. For a tail, yak’s tails are fastened in with his own hair, which, for the occasion, is allowed to hang down instead of being tied up. The performer commences to dance a shuffling step to the usual music. In front of him dances the priest, who goes through the pantomime of beckoning to the animal to come to him. The remaining guests of the nokma form a line of dancers behind the “horse”. When the first man gets tired, another takes his place, and the dancing goes on right through the night. A pleasant part of the performance is the pelting of the guré with eggs. Strictly speaking, this festival should last for three days and two nights. When it is over, the guré is taken to a stream and the body thrown into the water, the head being preserved for another year. The people who come to see it off, bring rice with them, and a meal by the water’s edge closes the proceedings. At the Wangala, it is the custom to mix flour with water, and for the assembled people to dip their hands into the mixture and make white hand-marks on the posts and walls of the house and on the backs of the guests."
411,"Pongsi-nina. A thin slip of bamboo about a foot long is tied into a bow with a piece of cotton thread. At one end of the bow a short length of string is allowed to hang down. This loose end is rubbed on the body of the sick person who seeks information. The priest then lifts up the bow by the tight string, holding it lightly between the forefinger and thumb of the right hand, while with the left hand he supports the right wrist. He then commences to call upon the gods by name, one after the other, and it is declared that the bow will begin to oscillate when he reaches the name of the spirit to whom sacrifice must be offered."
412,"Risal-nina. A cup of water and some grains of uncooked rice are required. Holding the cup of water in his left hand, the priest drops the rice into it, grain by grain, calling out the name of a spirit as each grain falls. The spirit named at the moment in which two floating grains come in contact with each other, is the one who must be propitiated."
413,"When a woman is about to be confined of the birthing, her husband vows to offer up a sacrifice of a bull, a goat, or a fowl, according to his means, if the child is safely born. The vow is fulfilled immediately after the birth, or, if the labour is of long duration, some time after its commencement. The animal or bird is killed outside the house by the kamal, who recites a long incantation to avert the influence of evil spirits. The women who are attending the expectant mother have a like duty to perform. Rice is scattered on the floor of the house round their patient, and a chant kept up, of which the following is a translation: “Go away! go away! evil spirit; in the way of the n °ama, of the na °sa, of the banggni, and of the giljaré do not stand watching; do not prevent it; do not wait for it; do not watch; do not lick; do not swallow; do not smack your lips; do not let your mouth water.” The names above mentioned are those of fish, and they are intended as symbols for the child which is about to enter the world."
414,"Should the birth be long deferred, a goat is brought into the house, and its body placed in contact with that of the woman. At the same time the kamal takes a little water in his mouth, blows it in a fine spray over the woman, and utters the word “ poinrang, ” which seems to be nearly equivalent to “good luck.”"
415,"As soon as the navel string on the child has fallen off, the mother and infant are taken down to a stream and bathed. Before starting for the bath, a long bamboo is forced through the roof of the house into the main room, close to the wall of the sleeping apartment, and through the floor to the ground beneath. At the foot of this bamboo, in the house, a sambasia or sacrificial altar, is erected. On the return from the bath, the baby’s head is shaved, this is known as kni minsu gala, a little patch of hair is left untouched on the top of the head. The priest then offers a prayer at the altar for the happiness of the child."
416,"After the head shaving the child’s father climbs up on to the roof of the house, taking with him the sambasia (altar) and a fowl. He cuts off the bird’s head, and allows its blood to drip down the above-mentioned bamboo, on to the floor beneath. The bamboo is then cut through by the priest, and the father, having hauled it up, throws it and the sambasia away. He also throws to the ground the body of the fowl, and where it falls, there must it be cooked and eaten. The father of the child and the priest alone are allowed to partake of it; any friends who may have assembled being treated to liquor only. The beak and crop of the fowl are placed on a piece of plantain leaf and offered to the gods."
417,
418,"Throwing the firestick, marks the beginning of the work of the gods rites. Attended by only a few people this ritual involves waiting for a stick to burn through on a fire. Once this is done an assistant powders some of the charcoal on a stone, presses his finger in it and draws a line down the forehead of the chief. This marks the beginning of certain restrictions on behavior."
419,"Resacralisation of canoes, faunga vaka. This occurs over 3 days (the day of the adze, the day of the Elders and the day of the canoe rites). In short the whole period involves repeated recitation of formulas that protect participants from the deities as they remove the sacred adze from its temple and demand efficacy of the canoe rituals being performed. The vessels are anointed with oil and an offering of bark-cloth is made to its tutelary deities. Numerous kava rites are performed during this period. The object of the rituals is to ensure that fishing is successful."
420,‘A primitive communion feast’ (Firth). Yam tubers are taken out of the oven and the bearer of the yams runs through the doorway and distributes them. Instead of the usual polite style he hurls them out. The men catch the yams in leaves and try to be the first one to eat a bite of theirs. Once this happens this man calls out. Another man enters and distributes more yams in the orthodox fashion. A kava libation is made. People eat their share of the food.
421,"Early in the morning after the clearing of the yam plots the rite of soani autaru was performed. In the clearing of the mara a single shrub has been left untouched in the middle of the field. Before sunrise a man arrives at the cultivation, and with a single stroke, if possible, cuts down the shrub and leaves it lying on the ground. A good swinging blow is used that the shrub may fall with a crash so that the deity may hear from the heavens, it is said. Then the man gathers a load of coconuts, together with breadfruit or other food, and returns to Kafika where a simple rite takes place. I attended this with six other people. It was the kava a niu, offerings being made of the coconuts, from which libations were poured when the kava was finished. Later the oven was prepared and when ready in the afternoon the ordinary minor kava was performed again. Appeals were made to the gods primarily for coconuts, then scarce, but since the sea was calm no reference was made to it."
422,"Sacred rites of planting. A man carrying a sacred stick goes ahead of the main party, into the darkness, torches are forbidden. Other participants leave later and race against the dawn to get the plateau where the cultivation occurs. On the plateau Ariki squatted down with his digging stick held before him, and the others formed a ring and followed suit, their sticks all pointing inwards. The bearer of the koso came up and, silently standing at the side of the Ariki, directed his sacred implement towards the same spot. Then the Ariki squatting thus, recited a short formula termed te fakasao o te puke, “The countenancing of the hillock”. As he concluded the formula he drove his stick into the ground and as he did so, uttered a ringing cry of “Iefu!”. As one man the crowd too drove in their sticks and yelled on the high shrieking note characteristic of the Tikopia. After the preliminary plunging-in of the sticks the hillock was dug properly. A formula wishing that the yam will grow well is spoken. A couple of leaves of coconut had been out and laid across the sacred hillock as a screen. A long pole was also cut, and to its upper end was attached the noa, a trailing strip of brand-new white barkcloth. The pole was set in the ground, and in the morning breeze the cloth streamed out like a pennant. The yells emitted at the beginning of the digging need explanation. They signalise the momentous occasion of the passing of the period of most intense tapu (restrictions), now that the sacred yam is once more being safely set in the soil when the yam is planted on Maunga it is the custom for the crowd to give a series of yells, and from time to time during the work the cry of some light-hearted lad goes ringing across the valley"
423,"The rites of Somosomo are composed of a series of incidents which, though in no way spectacular to a casual witness, are yet of the deepest religious interest to the natives. The rites begin with long and weighty invocation. This also was the comment on it of the Ariki Kafika who, in his pre-eminence, is careful to hold the scales even in regard to the relative importance of his elders. It must be noted that the attitude of these men towards each other is not one of struggle for position. Invocation and weeds are cleared. This is followed by the plaiting of the sacred mats. When the actual plaiting began the taboo of silence was imposed: the women might not speak to each other, nor the men to them. Thus the women on their return with the coconut fronds from Matorotoro expressed their indignation at another, not a participant, who had bathed that morning near the spot where the fronds lay. “No one should go near when the Work is in progress,” was the comment passed. While the mats were being thus arranged the oven was uncovered and the food when prepared was brought to the marae for the ceremonies, the “kava of the mats”. The kava was made with great formality on this occasion, although so few men were present to take part. Especial attention was paid to the seating of the principal participants, each being on the mat of his own deity. Exchange of marriage gifts. Plaiting of sacred baskets followed by kava ceremony. Provision of fish for the ovens. Then came the symbolism so characteristic of the Tikopia religion, the fiction that certain persons were for the time being deities in the flesh. The two baskets made during the afternoon were held to be baskets of Pufine ma, those two dread sisters who under various names find place in the kava list of nearly every family of note. When darkness fell the baskets were taken by two women, who went down to the beach and there personified the goddesses, receiving the tribute that was their due from the fisherfolk. Dirge song. Kava libation."
424,"The Dance to Quell the wind. Firth recorded more than sixty songs chanted during this festival of Marae. First, however, came the rite of “the Drinking,” which was essentially a series of kava libations connected with the offering of fresh coconuts to the Gods. The kava was made at Muafaitoka, cups being carried to the various Ariki in turn as already described. After this brief ceremony the chiefs went to join the crowd, which, after gathering at Fenumera, had gone to Matavi to await their arrival. The first dance was the Vetu. A hollow square was roughly formed, the people facing inwards with the side nearest Marae constituted by the chiefs alone. After a moment's silence all looked at the chiefs, and a wild yell broke out, “Iefu!” The song was now started, the time being kept by clapping of the hands with a rising motion. At first the demeanor was restrained and the arms alone were swung. Gradually however the rhythm was felt more and more deeply, and, though with no change of tempo, the excitement began to grow. Bodies turned in unison first to one side, then to the other, while the knees bent and rose in co-operation with the swinging of the arms. The song was chanted in high tones in quick time. The correct method of beating time was to lift them high up -- in completion of the movement. The more vigorous of the dancers thus exhorted the others “Lift them up”! in an endeavour to animate the proceedings still more. Towards the end of the stanza, when a kind of refrain was introduced with the words “Riele, riele”, the hands were not merely allowed to swing up and down, but urged up in a sweeping gesture, and the volume of sound waxed accordingly. As the dancers became more fired, stamping with the foot was also introduced to synchronize with the simultaneous clap of the hands. The spectacle was a dramatic one. Each song ended with a whoop that made all the cliffs of Uta echo and re-echo. A short pause ensued before the next song was raised, during which the participants remained silent, mostly with eyes cast down to the ground. It was noticeable also during the dance that the men avoided each others' eyes but looked up to the hills, or out over the lake. It was tapu to laugh or joke during the proceedings, since the dance was that of the gods. “It is tapu; male deities do not go to the women.” It was believed in fact that each party not only represented but actually embodied the deities of its own sex who had come to attend the singing. After four or five songs had been chanted the aso, or anea kamu, of betel was brought in. Two men set the bunches down in front of him, slightly to his right side, they did not turn round, but marched off the Marae by the opposite exit, with hands clasped and heads bowed in orthodox style. Thence they walked round again to the house, making a circuit, and entered with the second load, and after that a third, mainly of betel leaf. A special song was chanted for the bringing of the betel, but after this the singing of the men ceased. By now the dancing and singing had been pursued for nearly two hours. Hence the clapping was not nearly so vigorous as at the commencement, and some people made hardly more than a pretence at beating time. At last the songs ended, and the crowd dispersed. The “evening kava” was then performed, by each chief separately, his own bowl being set near his own seating mat."
425,"Dance of the Flaming Fire, which includes the Dance of the Bamboo. The latter is a sexual dance, involving participants acting like man in copulation. The words of the song are foreign to ordinary conversation: like those of the uru previously mentioned they are held to be archaic, and their meaning can be explained only by elderly, well-informed men. The stanzas do not embody any continuous statement or set of ideas, but merely present a number of words of erotic significance in conjunction. After the Dance of the Bamboo preparations were made to construct the Shed of the Fire, for the ritual of the night. The thatch of the shed had been pinned together by the households of the chiefs during the day, each chief himself as a rule taking part in its manufacture. While the dance of the matavaka was being performed in the late afternoon poles were cut and quickly set up in position on one side of the mound where the kava of Muafaitoka was made. The shed was completed just as it was getting dusk, and the evening kava was prepared immediately. Pa Rarovi, who had gone off alone, was meanwhile in his house preparing the torch; he waited until he considered that the correct time had arrived to perform his task. This was one of the crucial moments of the ritual, he knew that he could delay all the proceedings and keep the four chiefs waiting with impunity. He held the torch so that its end rested on the ground by the fire and the butt was inclined over his head. He then began to chant softly to himself and rubbed the end of the torch along the ground, approaching it slowly to the blaze, until it caught alight. This was the tutunga afi, the Kindling of the Fire. He moved off with stately step along the special track leading from his house to the main path, a way which was sacred, and was trodden only by the bearers of the Fire of the Gods. His progress was extremely sacred, and though people gathered at the entrance to Marae to await his approach, none might speak to him. The Sacred Fire was maintained thus all through the night, fresh taume being added whenever it died low. A man was always seated behind the leaf screen to tend it; in olden days, it was said, two men shared this task. When the watcher tired, after an hour or so, he made a sign to one of the dancers, and this man dropped out of the ranks and relieved him. In the dance men crouched motionless while the tempo of the song quickened and the rhythm changed from a single slow alternative beat to two single beats followed by two double beats. As the beat quickened still more, and the song swelled out there was a sudden movement from the crouching figures. With a simultaneous leap they sprang high into the air, throwing their arms above their heads, and waving across each other the palm fronds held in their hands. With an agility surprising in men of such heavy build they sprang again and again, almost without a sound, for they landed on their toes each time. It was tapu to thud to the ground in the dance. Even the waving of the palm fronds was done silently. They leaped and crouched, swung their leaf fans, and turned to one side and to the other with set gestures, in conformity with the rhythm. Then they stiffened again into immobility as each chanted stanza ended. It was a weirdly impressive spectacle, especially to one who saw it as I did, in the moonlight, which was yet not bright enough to give an air of reality to the scene. The song of the Bamboo in particular is an example of a sacred tauangutu. These songs, though usually erotic to a high degree, are not love-ditties. They are essentially of derisive kind, a challenge to the opposite sex, imputing bodily imperfections and absence of virtue, linked with unbridled desire. They are sung alternatively in challenge and answer and the object of the one sex is to reciprocate and if possible surpass the song of the other. The atmosphere is one of humour, and some of the songs have certainly wit in them. The concluding rite of the Urangafi was one of great sacredness. It was a kava rite of the ordinary type, but its specific object was to render the Marae tapu so that once again no one might set foot beyond the border of the path."
426,"First comes the ritual digging of the sacred turmeric. After the morning kava at Somosomo, on the fifth day of these rites, the Ariki Kafika orders one of his kinsfolk to perform this task. I did not see it done, but in 1929 was present when he sent off his son and another youth to dig up the hillock of turmeric he had planted in Maunga in the monsoon season. He said to them, “Bruise it to be pungent to the skies; it is the perfume of the Deity.” According to him, the operator plunges his digging stick in beside the plant and levers it up. As he recites a formula. This rite is known as “te furi o Te Akoako”, “the turning of the Akoako”. The idea is that the scent of the roots, levered up, rises to the sky, apprises the Atua i Kafika of the beginning of the work and induces him to grant good weather for it. “The Akoako is turned to act on the sky to stand well; the nuanga is going to be made.”"
427,"Nuanga, grating of turmeric. During these proceeding a number of rules or taboos limit the freedom of the workers. These are distinctly onerous, involving restrain in matters of food, sleep, physical relaxation, social and sexual intercourse. Their manifest object is to secure the final product in the proper state. From the evening of the day on which the turmeric is first grated a segregation of the nuanga workers begins. An intangible barrier now separates them from the rest of the village; they are “within the nuanga”, or “living in the nuanga”, and the rest are “the crowd without (te faoa i nga uta)”, or simply “those at the back (sa tua)”. Limited conversation is permitted between the two groups, but they may not sit or eat together. Once the expert sees that the turmeric has in fact settled firmly at the bottom he orders the bowl to be tipped up and the water poured completely off. The renga then appears as a dark red slime. The expert scrapes this out with his fingers into a small bowl held below; it comes away fairly cleanly, revealing beneath a yellow deposit of tauo. This is left untouched for the time, though a couple of cups of fresh water are run over its surface to wash down the last traces of renga. As each of the larger bowls is relieved of its renga into the smaller bowls, these are set as closely as possible round the marking stone of the rotoa. In this neighborhood, presumably, the manu is strongest. They are placed carefully on little mats specially plaited from coconut frond, wedged firm with pebbles, and covered over. There are two sets of these small bowls, one containing the bulk of the renga, the other the small amount of pigment held in the water with which the tauo was washed down. The renga is so precious that no trace of it is wasted; this is a ritual as well as technical precaution, since the deities would be offended at anything savoring of carelessness. The small bowls, kumete fai renga, are about two feet long by nine inches deep, and 25 or 30 of them are necessary for the work. Before use they are thoroughly washed out with salt water, and then with fresh, and then rubbed inside and out with the pauango residue."
428,"The annual dova for rain, when women pray collectively to ensure a fertile soil and a rich crop, they seek blessing not only for their own households, but for the village community as a whole. It was usually said that the event took place only in cases of severe drought, but in practice it seems to have been held annually anyway, to prevent drought later on in the summer. While the bula recites and says prayers, the participants hold their hands flat out toward the ground to illustrate rain falling. Every spring, in Dolina, there were prayers for rain at the three different sehits’ graves in the village."
429,"Friday prayer, sermon and prayers. In Dolina, between 5-7 people attend each week"
430,"The women’s tevhid involves congregational prayers for the dead. It is held five times following the death of any individual, male or female, usually in the house of the deceased. The first is held on the day the deceased is carried away from the house. The ritual is repeated on the seventh and fortieth days, after six months, and after a year. First, women’s tevhids are held at the home of the deceased and are led by a bula; men do not attend. Like the mevlud, the women’s tevhid is an occasion for individuals to strive to impress others and prove their capabilities both in religious matters, as by displaying religious knowledge and reciting well, and in secular activities as by cooking and organizing the event. A woman will also signal the socioeconomic status of her household and earn prestige by the manner in which she dresses (this is the case for all guests), the number of guests she entertains, the number of Islamic instructors called upon to recite, and the amount and quality of the food served. Following a series of amins, when the hands are held, palms up, in front of the face, the tevhid recitals finish with prayers “as a gift” in the name of the deceased (it is requested that the prayers be received on his or her behalf and for his or her benefit). Prayers are then given in the name of other deceased close relatives of the household sponsoring the tevhid, and of other participants who ask for it. Finally, prayers are said in the name of “all our deceased.” The local bula also used to say prayers on behalf of all deceased relatives of the hostess of the tevhid up to the “ninth degree.” After the recitals and prayers are over, women will engage in relaxed talk until they are invited to the table to eat. Food is usually served only once, except in prosperous households where it is served both before and after the recitals. Now they will meet women from other villages who may have news about relatives or neighbors from their native village. They exchange information about who has married, who has died, and who has had a child. They will also learn about forthcoming rituals and celebrations such as mevlud, tevhid, or weddings sponsored by other households."
431,"A mevlud is specifically held in celebration of the birth of the Prophet Mohammad. However, it is also held in association with other happy events which celebrate life and for blessing. There are two kinds of mevlud: the annual celebration of the birth of the Prophet Mohammad held in the mosque (coded here), and those held throughout the year in private homes (see coding for private mevlud below). A mevlud consists of prayers and the chanting of specific mevlud poems praising the birth and life of the Prophet. There can be an emphasis on didactics and on preaching. 'A hodza familiar with the region told me there were no particular rules for mevlud and that “everybody has their own traditions” (for example, the dervishes shout more and louder Allah illalahs)'. He claimed, furthermore, that there was no difference between the texts used in men’s and women’s mevlud, and that women’s mevluds do not have any particular characteristics that distinguish them from men’s. It became clear, however, that although there was no difference in the specific texts used, there was more emphasis on didactics and emotional preaching in this urban style mevlud than in mixed village mevluds and those by and for men where the emphasis is on the performance of texts. More prosperous households or members of the Muslim religious elite often give a mevlud annually. Prestige is gained by inviting a large number of guests, especially if some of them are well-known Islamic reciters and leaders, and also by being able to pay for several hodzas (or bulas ) to recite. The amount and quality of food is a final source of prestige."

434,"Ramazan (Arabic Ramadan) the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a month-long time of fasting from sun-up to sun-down. The fast is ended by the three-day festival of Ramazanski-Bajram, during which the Muslims visit and congratulate one another, often bestowing presents of sweets or other foods upon their relatives and close friends. The occasion is all the more festive because the fast of Ramazan has been completed."
435,"At least the majority pray daily, not the prescribed five times except during Ramazan, but at least three times daily during the winter and twice daily during the summer when there is less free time"
436,"The mukabela is a gathering of several hafiz in the mosque to recite the qur’an aloud from beginning to end. This reading is called a hatma. At Ramadan, when the mukabela usually takes place, some will pay their hodza well to read a hatma on behalf of a deceased close relative or relatives; this is believed to earn both the deceased person and the person who recites or sponsors the recitation sevap (reciting earns greater sevap than sponsoring it, but not all people know how to read the Qur’an). In villages like Dolina a group of Muslims who know how to recite the Qur’an gathered in the mosque every day during Ramadan with the local hodza to read a hatma . It is prestigious for a devout Muslim to participate in the mukabela; in most towns men are the reciters, yet in Dolina the reciters were a group of women led by the hodza ."
437,"Sveti Roko. The church bells ring to announce the day of Saint Roko, the protector against pestilence and plague who is the Patron Saint of the village. Patron Saint’s day in Sutivan is tied in with prayers for rain. At 8 A.M. on August 16, begins a traditional ceremony that will draw together a large part of the community. At the door of the “old church,” the church of Saint Roko on the hill overlooking the village, an elderly man chants the life story of Saint Roko. Inside the church people fill the pews and stand about listening with some indifference to the chanting of the man at the door. People crowd about the statue of the saint to touch it, some place flowers upon it. Near the altar the priest hears confession. One woman goes about trying to hush the murmur of the crowd, but there appears to be too much of an air of excitement, and the murmuring and milling about continue. Near the end of the chant, candles are extinguished. Four young men, who are to carry the burden of the statue during the processional, come into the church dressed in white robes with a green mantle. They are solemn and barefoot. As the chant ceases, the congregation within the church sings old Croatian hymns. During the singing, the saint on the shoulders of the four young men emerges from the church and the processional is organized. With the banner of St. Teresa leading the way, the procession starts down the long cypress lined cobblestone path to the village below. The path has much meaning for the individuals of the village as it is also the last processional path for them, the same route, only in reverse direction, that their funeral processional will take to the cemetery. Children lead the processional, followed by the men of the village, with the women bringing up the rear. Young men and women are dressed in bright colors, old women are in black with missals and rosaries. Over half the people in the village follow the processional as it winds through the village and along the quay to the “Great Church” on the waterfront. The choir from Postira, a larger and yet supposedly more traditional village, leads the saint and the processional moves along in song. The processional enters the Great Church. A group of village men sing hymns outside and young boys still light fire-crackers. The church is crowded with people partaking in the High Mass conducted by a visiting priest from Split. 350 people who took part in the processional. However, only 160-175 attended Mass. Many of the men waited outside during Mass."
438,"One week after the Patron Saint’s day when the statue was brought down the hill to spend a week in the great church, there is a processional to return the statue to its church. This begins with he late afternoon Mass. (There is a Mass every afternoon at five o’clock.) Following Mass, the statue emerges from the church amidst some disorganization. The four young boys who are to carry the statue are younger than those who carried it a week earlier. Again, many had waited outside the church not attending Mass. Finally, a boy carrying the banner of St. Teresa again leads the processional, children leading, followed by men with the women bringing up the rear. A few men are in the processional and it is smaller--maybe only 230 people--than the previous week. The choir from Postira is not in attendance and the chants are sung by the congregation itself. (They had sung along with the choir the Sunday before.) A few more men join the processional as it proceeds through the village by a different route than it had taken the week before. They move past the school and start up the hill on the back side of the village. In the distance are terraced fields, some of which still contain vineyards and olive groves. Many of the women have dropped out of the processional along the way and it is down to around 100 villagers, many of whom are barefoot, some with flowers. They reach the top of the hill overlooking the village, passing by a pine wood and the cemetery. The bells of the old church ring and men sing outside."
439,Attendance at daily Masses tends to be quite sparse. A dozen women make it a practice to attend regularly
440,"On Palm Sunday children come through the village carrying olive branches on their way to the 10 o’clock Mass. In the church 110 villagers gather for Mass 25 men, 45 women, and 40 children. The children participate, reading parts of the scripture. During the service 22 women and children take communion; however, no men do this."
441,"Traditionally on Good Friday there is a Mass in the evening at 7:30, followed by a processional through the village. People place candles or lights in their windows for this. This year, since it was raining slightly, there was no processional. It was said that many people would have joined the processional who had not attended Mass. In the church, close to 200 villagers are gathered for the Mass with 40-45 of these being men in their traditional place in the balcony in the rear of the church. The comment was made by a man, “During Holy Week I attend church, but not much otherwise.” Children have wooden noisemakers which they play during Mass and which are used during the processional. At one point during the service the women and children come forward to kiss the feet of the crucifix and a few women take communion. Again, no men take communion and it is necessary for an altar boy to carry the crucifix up to the balcony so that the men are able to kiss it."
442,"The Resurrection of Christ is celebrated with a 10 P.M. to midnight Mass on Velika Subota--Great Saturday. The church is completely darkened and a fire burns outside the church as an altar boy gathers live coals to light the incense. The priest comes from the church with some of the congregation to light a candle which is then carried into the darkened church. From this single light the congregation then light candles. The bells of the church have not rung since Friday evening, but with the conclusion of the Saturday evening Mass, they ring to rejoice and to announce the Resurrection to the village."
443,"Every household in the community tries to send a member to attend the funeral processional. The processional has a traditional path that it follows. After the deceased is taken from the home by the community, the processional proceeds along the quay and always enters the church. After Mass, the deceased and processional always leave the church yard by way of the stairs in back and proceed up the cypress lined path to the cemetery. The processionals varied in size from 160 members to over 280 and were always held after the afternoon bus and ferry had arrived to bring family members from outside the community. Considering that many people have to work a shift in the factory and that only a few children participate as altar boys or wreath carriers or as immediate family members the processionals are remarkable for their size."
444,"Beginning of the Christmas season, marked by an indio bárbaro procession. We were awakened at 6:30 a.m. by the sound of drums coming down the street. The procession was led by a man dressed up as “un indio bárbaro ” (a wild Indian). He had a bunch of leafless tree branches tied around his head and was wearing a piece of cloth that looked like a short skirt. The procession went as far as the calvario. Then the man went inside a nearby house and took off his costume. I was told that a similar event would take place on the 15th of January."
445,"Palo de Pascua. Around 11:00 a.m. a Christmas procession began called Palo de Pascua. Ten women each carried a long stick which was topped by a cluster of multicolored tissue paper streamers. The group danced from house to house, as more women joined the procession. Some carried long, leafy tree branches without paper streamers. At each home they sang Christmas carols in Spanish at the door briefly, then went inside and continued singing for a few minutes. All of the women carried a maraca or rattle, some using a plastic baby toy. Throughout the singing the women pounded their sticks on the ground in unison. Accompanying the procession was a man who kept a written record of money contributed to the singers. At each house where the group stopped, the residents gave a small donation. The man told me that the money would be donated for a community project. After the adult procession, there was a similar event for little girls who were escorted by a few women"
446,"Wanáragua dance procession. The main participants were five men and two boys, all dressed in slightly different costumes. Generally these included loose blouses, wide collars extending to the shoulders or longer with 6 to 14 ribbons (red, green, white) hanging between the collar and the blouse, and a knee-length skirt. Two or more of these pieces were made of different patterns of brightly colored cloth. The dancers also wore stiff, pink-beige net masks with painted faces, scarfs tied around their heads and over their ears, elaborate headdresses, and knee rattles. Every headdress was slightly different in design. Each was made of brightly colored tissue paper and metallic streamers covering a wide forehead band of cardboard which had one or more upright sticks stuck in it. Wrapped around each leg the dancers wore a band of cloth several inches wide with small seashells sewn to it. These made rattling sounds as the dancers moved. All wore tennis shoes. Two of the men had on white gloves. One dancer carried a large maraca. The group was accompanied by two drummers in everyday dress who played rapid, complex rhythms on traditional instruments while female onlookers sang in Garifuna. The procession went from house to house, performing in front of several. While one dancer shook the maraca, each of the others took turns dancing before the drums, vigorously shaking their leg rattles. Residents at the homes where the men performed made small contributions of money and gave them drinks of aguar."
447,"New Year's Eve. Punta dances accompanied by singing and drumming were held all night long in the two club salons. At midnight, a candlelight prayer session in Spanish was conducted in the Catholic church by a rezadora and attended by several women."
448,"Día de los Reyes (Day of the Kings, Epiphany). A coropatillas (chorus of devils) masquerade dance began in the early afternoon. Ten males (seven men, three boys) in costume participated, accompanied by two drummers. The dancers went from house to house where the group was given small donations of money. At each stop the performance was similar, as the drummers played rapid, complex rhythms and female spectators sang in Garífuna. The man in the stuffed brown clothing danced in an irregular manner and then fell down on his back, kicked his feet in the air, and shook his arms while writhing in time to the music. Next the doctor jumped before the drums and danced up to the man on the ground. He knelt and listened to the man's heart. Then the doctor pulled a book out of his bag, held it up over the patient, and pointed to a spot on one of the pages. The book was put away and a bottle of rum was pulled from the bag, which the doctor used to fill an imaginary hypodermic needle. Then he pretended to give two injections to the patient, one on each side of his pubic area. The man on the ground jumped up suddenly and danced before the drums, followed by one of the women. The wolf danced over to the woman and she pushed him away. From behind a house the devil jumped into the open. He moved back and forth across the street before hiding again. Suddenly, he jumped out close-by and danced before the drums. Then the devil moved close to the woman in the red dress and repeatedly bumped the front of his body against hers. Other dancers surrounded the female character and bumped into her at the same time. A few minutes later, the dancing and drumming stopped and the group moved to another house. Judging by the clowning of the dancers and the laughter of the onlookers, it appeared that everyone thought this dance was hilarious."
449,"End of the Christmas season, indio bárbaro procession. This event occurred in the afternoon. The single male dancer wore a black shirt, black pants, and a tight fitting black sweater cap. In his waistband, up his sleeves, and up his legs were stuck manaca palm leaves so that his front, back, and face were almost obscured. Women singing in Garifuna and two drummers with traditional instruments accompanied him from house to house. The indio bárbaro danced at each location for a few minutes before the procession ended at the calvario."
450,"Miércoles Santo (Holy Wednesday), Viacrucis procession. On Wednesday evening the procession started at the Catholic church. About 20 women and a few young men participated. One man carried a long gray wooden cross (about five feet long) that had a small statue of Christ in the center. Two other men stood at his sides, each holding a burning white candle in a long gray wooden candleholder. The women sang hymns in Spanish as the procession circled through the village and returned to the church."
451,"Viernes Santo (Good Friday). 1) Viacrucis morning procession. A large framed picture of Christ holding the cross over his shoulder was carried through the village, along with a smaller framed picture of the Virgin Mary displaying the sacred heart. The multicolored picture of Christ was mounted on a board covered by a white sheet. At the bottom on both sides were two wooden handrails. Four men carried the picture of Christ. Immediately behind them a woman displayed the picture of Mary. The Catholic priest assigned to Santa Fe for Semana Santa walked along with the procession. He wore gray pants and a white shirt and carried a battery powered loud speaker. The procession moved up to the calvario and paused for a few minutes. There the priest blessed Santa Fe and urged people to be good Christians, recommending that they follow the pronouncements of Pope John Paul II who had recently visited Honduras. After the speech, the procession moved down the next street and back to the church as the participants sang hymns in Spanish."
452,"Viernes Santo (Good Friday). Santo Entierro (Holy Funeral). This procession began at the church around 4:30 p.m. The focus of the procession was a glass coffin trimmed with black wood. Inside, a white satin cushion extended the length of the coffin and was covered with pink and white flowers of tissue paper and plastic. Outside on top of the lid was a white, papier-mache dove. Attached beneath were four long white tissue paper streamers, two hanging over each side. The coffin set on a black wooden frame with two side hand railings, resting in the center aisle of the church. The priest explained how he wanted the procession to be arranged. Men and boys were to form a line on the right side of the coffin while women and girls were to stand along the left side. Four men had been chosen as pall bearers. Each of them wore a yellow sash hung from one shoulder diagonally across the chest. Also participating were four girls (approximately nine or ten years old) making their First Holy Communion who wore white dresses and veils. Two girls stood on each side of the coffin, each holding one of the paper streamers. The coffin was carried out of the church into the street. Approximately 100 spectators were present. In front of the procession walked a man playing a saxophone. The priest stood immediately behind the coffin. Hymns in Spanish were sung by the participants as the group moved toward the calvario. At various points along the way, wooden tables covered with cloth had been placed in the middle of the road. The coffin was rested on each table as the priest blessed some aspect of life in Santa Fe. Then he led prayers in Spanish to which the other participants responded. The procession continued to the calvario where it paused, without setting down the coffin. The priest blessed Santa Fe again and urged the people to follow the words of Pope John Paul II with regard to respectable behavior of women and the treatment of women with respect. After he led another prayer, the procession moved to the next street and circled back to the church. The coffin was set on tables along the way as the priest blessed the community."
453,"Viernes Santo (Good Friday). 3) Candlelight procession. After the Santo Entierro, the priest announced that there would be a special procession for women around 7:00 p.m. All participants were to bring a white candle. The women who gathered walked through the village carrying burning candles and singing hymns dedicated to the Madre Dolorosa (Lady of Sorrows). Then the procession returned to the church."
454,"Velada for San Antonio (St. Antony of Padua). The velada began at 6:00 p.m. in the home of a woman who said that she sponsored this event every year. I was told that two other veladas would be held this evening, in the village Catholic church and in another woman's home. In the living room of the house where the velada I attended was held, many brightly colored chromolithographs of the saints hung on the wall. Nearby, a beautiful altar had been prepared, dedicated to San Antonio. It had two tiers, one higher than the other, and was covered by a white cloth. Each tier had two burning candles (with two on the floor before the altar), three statues of San Antonio, and numerous framed pictures of San Antonio holding the baby Jesus, the Virgin of Suyapa (patron saint of Honduras), and Jesus and Mary displaying the sacred heart. The altar had two crucifixes, one in the middle of each tier, and another hung on the wall above. On the floor before the altar was a smoking incense burner made from a can. The burning mixture of leaves and wood filled the room with a sweet, pungent smell. On the lowest altar tier was a glass bowl filled with coins and two chicken eggs. The money and the eggs were offerings to the saint. At 7:00 p.m. the woman sponsoring the ceremony rang a small bell, signaling the beginning of prayers before the altar. One rezadora initiated the 45 minute session which was completed by another. Many of the prayers and hymns, all in Spanish except for one song in Garifuna, were addressed to the Virgin Mary. About 20 people participated, 10 women, 5 girls, and 5 boys. As the session ended, the rezadora took a glass of water, dipped a small leafy piece of greenery into it, and flicked water in the sign of the cross over the altar. The rezadora prayed and sang for another 15 minutes. Half an hour later, two men arrived with traditional drums and sat on chairs against the wall opposite the altar. They were joined by two more men, one with a pair of maracas and another with an animal jaw bone and a stick. The latter were used together as a percussion instrument. After other participants entered the room, the musicians played a type of song called parando, as men and women danced the punta. The domino playing and parando lasted until midnight."
455,"Moros v Cristianos dance (Moors and Christians). This event occurred around 4:30 p.m. in front of the Catholic church. There were 16 participants and a five-member band. The moros included one man, four women, and three girls, while the cristianos included another man, five women, and two girls. The band members played a bass drum, snare drum, saxophone, trumpet, and symbols. As the band played before the church, the moros and cristianos danced slowly in the street in two circular groups, waving their swords in the air in time to the music. Occasionally they formed two parallel lines and each person slowly crossed swords with a member of the opposite group. This dancing continued for about ten minutes. Then the moro with the star and crescent and the cristiano with the cross moved between the two groups to confront one another. Speaking in Spanish, they shouted challenges, exchanged positions, and repeated them. Then they crossed swords rapidly in mock battle. After this, a similar conflict occurred between two older women. Suddenly, the male cristiano rode on horseback into the dance area. He was challenged by the male moro who was on foot. The cristiano dismounted and the men struck their wooden swords together in a spirited fight as the crowd cheered them on. After the duel, the moros and cristianos danced briefly in the same manner as before."
456,"Velada for the Virgin del Carmen (Our Lady of Mt. Carmel). This is the most important event during the annual festival to honor the patron saint of Santa Fe. The calvario was the site of the velada. Over the cross, six men built a square shelter (about 15 feet on each side) with a roof of corrugated metal, supported by wooden beams, and three walls of manaca palm leaves. Six women decorated the interior and prepared an altar. Pastel-colored bed sheets were used to cover the walls. From the ceiling beams were hung pastel-colored tissue paper streamers. Five girls spread small wash basins of clean beach sand on the ground inside the shelter. A small, wooden table covered by a white sheet and a white lace cloth was set before the calvario. On top of it was placed a large, framed chromolithograph of the Virgin Mary and a single white burning candle. At 7:00 p.m. a priest from Trujillo conducted a mass in the church attended by approximately 70 people, about a third of whom were male. In the aisle was the statue of the Virgin Mary with baby Jesus that was usually in an alcove above the altar. Supported by a table, the Virgin rested on a platform with hand rails attached to the sides. The bottom of the statue was wrapped in pastel-colored cloth net decorated with tissue paper flowers. When the mass was over, four women picked up the platform and carried the Virgin outside. In the street a procession formed, led by the same band that had played for moros y cristianos. Behind them walked the women with the statue, followed by the other participants. As the band played, the procession moved towards the calvario. Upon arrival, the Virgin was placed in front of the altar, facing outward. In a semi-circle before the Virgin, ten long white candles were stuck upright in the sand and lit. A rezadora knelt before the altar and led the participants in prayer. A few women and children put woven straw sleeping mats on the sandy floor in preparation for the all-night vigil. In front of the shelter, two men with traditional drums played rapid, complex rhythms all night long as some participants, mostly women, danced the punta. The praying and hymn singing continued through the night with various women and teenage girls taking turns as rezadoras."
457,"Morning procession for the Virgin del Carmen. Before sunrise, the participants at the velada were served cups of strong, black coffee and coconut bread. The drums played as a few women danced the punta. A rezadora knelt in prayer, occasionally touching the face and hands of the Virgin. After sunrise, four women picked up the statue and carried it out of the shelter where they were met by the band and other participants. As the band played, the procession moved to the nearby soccer field and went all around its perimeter. Then the Virgin was carried to the beach. A cayuco (small wooden boat with outboard motor) with three male passengers was waiting in the water. Very carefully the Virgin was taken to the water line. Then the men in the cayuco and a few men on shore transferred the statue to the boat. Three women joined the men in the cayuco and sailed away. I was told that they were destined for nearby Cayo Blanco (White Key) and would circle it before returning to shore, after which the Virgin would be taken to the church."
458,"Afternoon procession for the Virgin del Carmen. At 5:00 p.m. four women carried the Virgin out of the church and into the street where another procession formed. The band went first, followed by the women with the statue. Behind them walked 25 other women, each holding a burning white candle. As the participants sang hymns, the procession moved towards the calvario. The Virgin was set down in front of the velada altar for a few minutes as a rezadora led prayers. Then the statue was picked up and the procession moved to the next street, circling the community, and returning to the church. This marks the end of the patron saint festival."
459,"Velada for San Miguel (St. Michael the Archangel). During the day one of my neighbors placed a small metal tray and a picture of San Miguel slaying a dragon on a chair set against the outside wall of her house facing the street. In the tray were several coins which she said were offerings to the saint. Tomorrow was the Dia de San Miguel (Day of St. Michael) and tonight in his honor she would conduct a velada in the Catholic church beginning at 7:00 p.m. The event took place before a side altar permanently dedicated to San Miguel. It was a small table covered by white cloth on which were placed a statue of San Miguel slaying a dragon, a crucifix, two burning white candles, and a metal trophy won by the community soccer team. Five wooden pews were turned to face the side altar. Nine women, including the rezadora, and three men participated in the hour long prayer session."
460,"Día de San Miguel. In the morning, more prayers for San Miguel were conducted at the altar. At 5:00 p.m. a procession began at the church. The saint was removed from the altar and placed in the back of a village transport truck so that he faced the street. Three women, including the rezadora, and two men sat next to San Miguel. Each person held a burning white candle. As the passengers sang hymns, the truck drove slowly to the calvario where it moved to the next street and back towards the church."
461,"Día de los Difuntos (Day of the Dead, All Souls Day). At 6:00 a.m. a special requiem mass was held in the Catholic church to remember the dead of Santa Fe. Approximately 25 women and 5 men attended. All of the women wore either black or black and white dresses and headscarfs. The men wore black pants and white shirts. Among the participants I recognized the relatives of two people who had died during the past year. In the center aisle rested the glass coffin carried during the Santo Entierro procession. Next to it on each side stood a three feet high, black wooden candle holder with a long burning white candle. On the floor before the coffin were approximately 50 small white candles, lit by members of the congregation in memory of their relatives. A rezadora led the congregation through the prayers of a requiem mass. At one point, she read a long list of names belonging to the deceased, repeating the phrase “descanse en paz ” (rest in peace) after each name. Later in the day, several men and women worked in the community cemetery, cutting down grass and weeds near the graves of relatives. Wreathes of white tissue paper flowers were hung on the white-washed crosses marking some of the graves."
462,"Wake for a Man in Triunfo de la Cruz: This ceremony was held for an old man who had died the previous morning. Approximately 150 people attended. The coffin was placed in the living room of the deceased's home. It was lined with a white sheet with the ends hanging over the sides. The dead man wore a dark gray suit. His nose and ears were stuffed with cotton. Four large burning white candles tied in the middle with black ribbon were placed in long, wooden candle holders at the corners of the table where the coffin rested. Several wreaths of fresh flowers leaned against the coffin while behind it was a small altar with chromolithographs of Jesus and the Madre Dolorosa. Several female relatives wearing black mourning clothes viewed the coffin from the doorway of an adjacent room where there was no light. Directly in front of the house a temporary porch area with a corrugated metal roof supported by wooden poles had been constructed. On the porch approximately 20 men sat and played dominos by the light of a kerosene lamp. Numerous women and other men conversed out in the yard. Many people had been drinking aguardiente. At 9:00 p.m. a group of people formed a circle about 25 feet away from the house. Two men, each with a medium sized Garifuna drum sat facing into the circle, looking toward the beach with the house behind them. Before them a long burning white candle was stuck in the sand. The drummers began to play rapid, complex rhythms. All of the women present sang in Garifuna. A man jumped into the circle and danced the punta. Then a woman moved in to accompany him. Soon other people joined the activity. Only one man and woman danced together at one time. As one person tired and moved away, a member of the same sex danced into the circle. Nearby, another group formed for adolescent females. No males participated. The girls, two at a time, joined hands and stood in line so that partners faced each other. As they sang in Garifuna, each pair ran under the upheld arms of the other girls until they reached the opposite end of the line where they resumed a position. Everyone did this once, and then the dance was repeated with the pairs moving down the line in the opposite direction. Afterwards, the girls formed a circle, placed a burning white candle in the center, and individually took turns dancing the punta to the rhythms coming from the adult gathering. As the dancing continued, several female relatives of the deceased prepared a meal in the nearby kitchen which would be served to the participants at midnight. In the house, another woman walked counterclockwise around the coffin, crying and singing to the dead man in Garifuna. I was told that the dancing would continue until dawn. Then the body would be taken to the church for a funeral service and from there to the cemetery for burial."
463,"Two other men brought a pallbearers' rack into the house so the coffin could be moved to the church. Secured by ropes to the rack, it was carried by four men into the street where a funeral procession formed. In front of the coffin walked two drummers and a saxophone player. Although the drums were traditional in construction, they were much shorter than others I had seen. Both were played with snare drum sticks in a slow, stately rhythm. The saxophonist played a funeral dirge. Behind the coffin stood family members, followed by many children of the community and other participants. The coffin was taken to the church where it was placed on a table in the center aisle before the altar. A rezadora led a 20 minute funeral service including hymns and prayers in Spanish with responses from the congregation. After the ceremony, the coffin was carried from the church. A procession formed again and moved to the house of the deceased. There the coffin was temporarily rested on a table placed in the street. Two highly respected men each gave an emotional speech in Spanish praising the accomplishments and good qualities of the deceased. When they were finished, the coffin was picked up and the procession moved toward the cemetery as the funeral dirge continued. The participants sang “Perdóneme señor, perdón, perdón. ” A woman distributed sprays of lavender flowers to young girls in the procession. At the cemetery the coffin was set on the ground next to an open grave about five-feet deep. Another community leader gave a speech praising the deceased, ending with “Descanse en paz ” (rest in peace). After he finished, someone else stepped forward, saying he wanted to give a proper blessing to the coffin. He knelt beside it, raised up both arms, and asked God to bless the deceased. With his right hand he made the sign of the cross over the entire length and width of the coffin. After this it was lowered into the grave with ropes. A gravedigger stood in the tomb to receive the coffin and place it evenly. He was handed a full liter bottle of aguardiente by a man standing above. The gravedigger poured it twice over the entire length and width of the coffin in the sign of the cross until the bottle was empty, repeating “Descanse en paz ” as he did so. This appeared to be an act of placation for the spirit of a powerful man. The girls threw their flowers on top of the coffin and the grave was covered with dirt. No further activities occurred that afternoon or evening."
464,"Novella; held in rememberance of deceased. All novenas share a common structure, the backbone of which is provided by Catholic ritual. Eight daily prayer sessions before an altar in the sponsor's house are followed on the ninth day by a requiem mass at the church and a ninth prayer session at home. On each day there is an hour long prayer session. Sessions occur infront of altar with two chromolithographs, one of Jesus and one of the Virgin Mary. On the eighth and the morning of the ninth day, female relatives aided by friends and neighbors prepared food for the large noon meal served to participants before the mass and final session of the novena. On the ninth day after the final prayer session storytelling often occurs in the house, whilst traditional drumming, singing, and punta dancing take place outside. men play drums in rapid, complex rhythms. Before them on the ground was a bottle of aguardiente with an overturned calabash cup covering its top. A long burning white candle was stuck in the ground nearby. A large number of participants, 30 or more during various times of the evening, gathered around, forming a large circle. A man and a woman danced the punta together as the others sang in Garifuna. Many people took turns dancing in the circle. The drummers and other participants occasionally drank aguardiente."

467,"Chugú is a one-day affair, essentially an elaborate offering accompanied by frequent prayers (led by the shaman and addressed at various points to God, Christ, the Virgin Mary, and individual ancestors), and by the singing of abaímahani. The food is usually offered in the house of the afflicted person, the offering displayed on tables in the morning and left there all day, until its final disposal. Other women in the community also bring plates of food, small offerings for their own ancestors. They leave the food beside the main offering until late afternoon, when they retrieve it and take it home. Some reportedly eat the food, but most claim to discard it or to give it to a very elderly person, who will not suffer ill effects by eating food that spirits have “tasted.” Chugú involves no drums, dancing, or possession — standard features of düg□ — and far less preparation and expense. (A shaman responded to a request for chugú from her dead father within three days, just after winning a large sum of money in the national lottery.) Even when chugú requires more advance preparation, it is largely a community affair, drawing few people, if any, from a distance."
468,"A dogo never lasts less than three days. A “house for the ancestors” (dabuiaba or gaiunare ) is built, this being a special feature of this rite. The main part of the dogo ceremony is, the dogo dance (adogorahani, literally, treading, compressing or gathering), which is supported by drum music, The presence of the ancestors. During these dances at a dogo is made dramatic by possession by the spirits of devotees, who as a rule, are unmarried girls, and who have been “prepared for receiving them.” Dancers dance with chickens under thier arms prior to thier sacrifice. There is the drinking of rum and eating together. Dogo rites are planned years in advance, and the economic resources of at least a dozen households are pooled. It is carried out at the request of a deceased person."
469,"Araíraguni is usually a small ceremony, involving no more than a dozen to fifteen people who gather in the gúle, sanctuary, of a temple. The afflicted person(s) may or may not be present, but one or more representatives must be. Typically this is the mother, grandmother, grown sister, or daughter of the afflicted. During araíraguni, the deceased grandfather of the sick person may complain that his descendants have neglected him. Perhaps they have repeatedly ignored his requests, made to them in dreams, for a small offering in the home: a plate of his favorite foods, a bit of rum, and a candle. He has retaliated by causing one or more of them to sicken. Now he demands chugú or perhaps düg□, specifying who is to contribute, the amount of their contribution, the various foods to be offered, the manner of the offering's disposal (either burial or disposal at sea), the length of the ceremony, and even the date. Very often a representative, or one of the several elderly women who usually attend any araíraguni, negotiates with the spirit on behalf of the descendants, perhaps pleading for more time in which to prepare. Spirits speak in peculiar voices, in high-pitched, wavering tones that are difficult to understand (except when they specify the sums of money to be contributed by various people, on which point they are remarkably clear!). One of the-oldest people present usually clarifies and explains many details of the spirit's demands to the others. When some agreement has been reached, those present bid the spirit good-bye. The shaman, screened from view and said to be in an altered state of consciousness during the interview, reappears suddenly in their midst. She may fall into the gathering from the screen that she retired behind earlier, or even from outside the building, having apparently been “lifted” from her place inside by the spirits. This ceremony may be repeated once more upon completion of chugú or düg□. At this final araíraguni, the ancestor who requested the ritual offering will announce satisfaction with it or demand further offerings, or even require that the entire rite be repeated."
470,"Amúidahani takes place in a yard, usually by the house where the deceased lived. A number of close relatives of the deceased, and often some invited guests, gather before dawn by a shallow pit the size of a grave, dug in the sand some hours before. The invited guests include a few of the women who “showed interest” in the previous ceremonies for the deceased by taking active part in them. Depending on their number, as many as twenty women and men may assemble in the pre-dawn darkness while the rest of the village sleeps. The ceremony itself is simple and brief. Each of the people present, beginning with the closest relative of the deceased — parent or grown child — throws a bucket of water into the pit. They do so in pairs, one person standing at the head of the pit and holding a bucket of the strained cassava water, sibida, and the other standing at the foot with a bucket of ordinary water. Throwing the water into the pit, each person addresses the spirit by the appropriate kin term and says, Iníha dúna lun bágawan, “Here is water for your bath.” After everyone has taken a turn the pit is covered. During amúidahani, a candle burns beside an offering of food and rum inside the house. As in the end-of-mourning ceremony, the food is set on a plate, and a suit of clothing belonging to the deceased hangs above it. When the pit has been covered outside, the women begin to distribute food and drink to the guests — bread and coffee first and later rum, after the singing has begun. The women sing abaímahani for several hours, with frequent pauses for liquid refreshment. Reluctant to abandon their singing and feeling the urge to dance, they eventually prevail upon a couple of men to provide the drumming that accompanies punta and other traditional dances. The festivities usually continue for a few hours longer, until the refreshments, if not the dancers, are exhausted."
471,"Like amúidahani, a Requiem Mass is scheduled in response to a request from the spirit of a deceased man or woman, who usually makes it in a dream to a close relative. If the priest prefers to conduct the Mass in town instead of traveling to the village for that purpose, one or several of the spirit's close kinswomen go there for the ceremony. Upon their return, there are brief prayers in the village church, usually led by a teacher and attended by older women and perhaps a few very old men. After the prayers, all adjourn to the house of the woman who sponsored the Mass, where the “feasting” begins. Bread and coffee are distributed; then the women sing abaímahani songs for several hours, dismissing the earlier solemnity of the prayers and slaking their thirst with rum. As in the case of amúidahani and tágurun lúdu, an offering of food and rum has been set beside a burning candle in a back room, together with a suit of clothing belonging to the deceased. Afterwards, the clothing is given away to “someone in need of it,” usually a very elderly man or woman. Although future offerings may be made to the spirit, the clothing is not necessary for them."
472,"Peyote rituals, held for curing or to secure other good fortune, e.g. for children about to start school. Some Navahos believe that there should be four curing meetings for complete recovery. Summary of ritual taken from Officiant Mike Kiyaani’s description. The opening of the peyote ritual involves singing and drumming. Recitation of prayers by officiants and patients are interspersed with ceremonial smoking and consumption of peyote. All participants sit in prepared places big enough to sit in but not to lie down, beginning at 8pm. Early in the ritual sage is passed round and rubbed on hands, body and head. Later water is sprinkled on participants using a feather. The is singing as breakfast is brought out. Participants have been awake all night. Not on procedure: a participants said ‘You have to rise toward it. If you are inspired to do so, you can make changes in the ceremony. You need not follow exactly what your teacher did: respect and reverence are the main things, not the details of the ritual’ (p.140)"
473,"Kinaaldá, Girls initation. Occurs over 5 days. Each day involves races of 15-20 minute duration and domestic chores (grinding corn, cleaning home, chopping wood). A cake is prepared over the course of the ceremony, the batter for it is poured into a pit and blessed, it consumed on the 5th day. The patient is ‘moulded’ and has her hair combed at the beginning and end of the ceremony. On the forth night participants stay up all night singing. The patient is painted and other participants change their clothes, more songs are sung."
474,"Mild cases of delirium and insanity are treated by a ceremony known as ‘turning the basket. the chanter gives the patient a pipe and the actual ritual commences. The person who is ill smokes the pipe ‘in a sacred way.’ After this the basket is carried to a place near the doorway,’ As soon as the patient starts toward the basket, the chanter begins the singing. At certain intervals in the song the patient turns the basket a complete clockwise turn. This action is repeated three times. On the fourth time the basket is given a turn and a half so that the break in the design and the ketans face the west. The patient then resumes his seat, the basket is brought in, and the ceremony is complete."
475,"Should the symptoms of the delirium or insanity recur a ritual called ‘circle of corn’ is performed. The main features of the rite are a special prayer and a cornmeal painting. The patient takes his place in the west side of the hogan and the chanter begins the meal painting. He first makes a solid circle of white cornmeal; representing clouds. Then going from east to west and from south to north he quarters the circle with yellow corn pollen. Next, on the periphery of the circle, ‘cloud peaks’ of white cornmeal are drawn at each of the cardinal points. The corn stalks, ears of corn, and blossoms (which are drawn next) are also of white cornmeal. The bottom leaf on each stalk must turn downward, going clockwise. Finally the ‘footracks,’ of yellow corn pollen are drawn and the actual ritual begins. The chanter sings a long song. During the course of the song the patient walks around the fire clockwise, on the attached ‘footracks,’ and again takes his place in the west. The family of the person who is ill may do likewise. When the song is ended the chanter also enters the meal painting by means of the ‘footracks’ and takes his place beside the patient. The patient is then seated in the center of the painting and a prayer is said which completes the ceremony. The painting is destroyed and carried outside. ‘This ceremony is certain in case the other one does not work.’”"
476,"Hand trembling ritual to divine illness. The hand trembler (officiant) takes pollen and going from right to left, puts it on the soles of the feet, knees, palms of the hands, breast, between the shoulders, on top of the head, and in the mouth of the patient. Finally the chanter throws some pollen into the air saying, ‘from now on may you always live in good health.’ The officiant takes more pollen and beginning at a vein in the inside of the elbow, follows it along the inside of the arm, passes over the thumb and back to the starting place. Then from the same starting place he runs pollen down to the tips of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. As he puts the pollen from elbow to thumb he prays, ‘Black Gila Monster I want you to tell me what is wrong with this patient. Do not hide anything from me. I am giving you a jet bead to tell me what the illness of the patient is.’ This prayer is repeated for each finger, substituting Blue Gila Monster and turquoise bead for the index finger, Yellow Gila Monster and haliotis shell bead for the middle and ring fingers, and White Gila Monster and white shell bead for the little finger. The chanter repeats this whole ritual and the accompanying prayers four times. While this is taking place no one may walk around inside the hogan, or enter or leave. All those present must be quiet. The officiant sings a song and his hand will begin to shake. He may sing the song through once or twice depending on how soon the revelation comes to him. As soon as he ceases to sing his hand stops trembling. According to informants the information may come in two ways; the chanter either interprets the meaning of the motions his hand makes when shaking or else the revelation comes directly from the Gila Monster."
477,"The female Shooting Life chant, takes 2 nights and a day to perform. Participants do not sleep during this period. During the first night songs are sung whilst medicine is soaked. The patient is naked except for a gee string. A bath is prepared and references made to caridinal directions. Illness is washed downwards from patients head to feet. The patient is given some bitter medicine and allowed to walk outside for a while before he is called back in, for a second period of singing, accompanied by rattles, which occurs during the day. Towards the evening the ‘first chant’ (atsałe) was then begun, and during it the patient was painted. As an assistant appointed to do the painting rose, the patient also stood. Black grease was applied, first with small dabs in ceremonial order and then plentifully across the chin from ear to ear. Red grease was rubbed all over the body including the face. The patient was called to the ho'yan, where everyone had assembled, and after taking his seat at the west he removed first his moccasins and necklace, placing them at the north of the altar, and then all his clothes except a gee string. After the patient had reentered the ho'γ an and taken his seat the first arrow chant was begun (k'a biyi'n), and during it he was given the four drinks of liquid medicine from the abalone shell, prepared and administered as before. Then followed the second arrow chant, and during this the assistant gave the patient the first dose of dry powdered life medicine from the two sacks. The male and female digging sticks (gíc) were used as spoons or spatulas, first the male and then the female for each of the two sacks, making four generous mouthfuls of the bitter, astringent mixture at each dose. This treatment was repeated nine times during the night, at about the middle of each of nine groups of songs which followed in succession.” The patient was told that after the first treatment with dry medicine he could put on his clothes or a blanket and could smoke if he wished. He was required,however, to sit up straight throughout the ceremony, and of course he must not doze. In the morning the diyin diné'é are ready to go to their homes in the east. After the daylight has arrived they will be gone. The patient is going to ‘swallow the daylight’ in order to get back his health. He must do this while the diyin diné'é are still present; for they are watching, and if he does it correctly they will take him away from the bad spirits, from disease. The patient was not allowed to sleep until past noon. The ceremony is not officially over until afternoon."
478,"Embahi 'separation' ceremony. Initiates are brought from the bush into the village, Having entered the village, they form two advancing lines until a large scaffolding is reached, erected at one end of the village. Turning, the men kneel down facing the entrance from which they have come and remain in this position, still keeping silence. It is at this stage that the candidates are presented. Faint cries arise from the bush, becoming louder and louder, and the words “Shi! Shi!” mingled with yells and shrieks are distinguished, and at the same time the candidates are marshalled in, led by their guides. They advance between the lines of men who, hitherto silent, now break up into groups, each catching a lad and running madly up and down the village, followed by the women, waving spears and all uttering cries and yells and rubbing the youngsters' arms, legs, and bodies. They now make a wild rush towards the scaffolding, throwing the lads on it, who endeavour to climb up out of reach, but are torn back by the mob and undergo further agony, until, utterly exhausted with fright and fatigue, they are allowed to climb away. Still retaining their group formation, the men rush forward to the scaffold uttering horrible yells, waving their heads sideways with faces upturned to the lads, and swinging their clubs, only to retreat again. This violence and pandemonium continue through the night. At daybreak the girl candidates are led in and subjected to the same treatment in somewhat milder form. Then the candidates, male and female, are mustered on the ohu platform, where they sit completely covered with hoods of bark-cloth. Trees are pulled down in the village."
479,"After several months of confinement in a part of hut, the girls initation ritual comes to an end with her debut. That morning, she is carried down to the river at earliest dawn on the shoulders of a woman, and there the oil and charcoal she has had plastered to her body are washed off. After this bath at day-break the remainder of the morning is given to decorating the girl. Her skin is oiled again, the hair is shaved back a little from her forehead and she is bedecked with feathers and ornament. They have been brought together in one house, before which is set up a screen of palm-leaves with an opening or gateway concealed behind curtains of bark-cloth. When all is in readiness, the curtains are drawn apart and reveal the girls standing abreast, with a young man on either flank, apparently as escort. The girls are armed with spears or pineapple clubs; and in one hand they may carry a bunch of ripe betel-nuts, or a new-painted bo, rolled up, which will presently serve as a dancer's shawl. The striking feature of their make-up is the bo or bark-cloth skirt which they are actually wearing. . This is of plain bark-cloth, unornamented save for splashes or smears of red; and in front and rear it has a hole which purports to expose their genitalia to the view of the onlookers. Thus attired the young women move slowly and in silence across the village and sit in a row on a log which their escorts have procured for them. After remaining some ten minutes on the log they rise and seat themselves on a coco-nut mat (tere ) spread on the ground; and then after another ten minutes or so they rise once more and mingle with their friends. They will subsequently join in the dance which has been organized for the occasion, and they will not discard their ornaments till sunset. The ceremony has not ended until they eat the purificatory stew called suna, and steam their bodies over it."
480,"Funeral proceedings. At death the body is painted and important people are laid out on a sloped platform. Some people hurt themselves in someway, for instance, clubbing or burning themselves. After 2 or so days the corpse is buried. Prayers are said and when the hole is filled in people throw themselves down into the swallow hollow remaining, jostling with each other for position"
481,"A few days prior to the actual gorukari, or emergence of the widow, the principal man of the village performs an interesting rite called jage or ‘hailing’. Soon after dusk the people of the village are assembled, the younger men holding drums and standing in readiness for a dance. Now, while all maintain a tense silence, the chief man raises his voice and in long-drawn notes cries out the name of the deceased. There is heard an inarticulate reply from somewhere in the bush, and the old man then continues in the same sounding tones to bid the deceased to be present and witness the descent of his widow from the house of seclusion, and to witness the feast and dance. Then the drums strike up and the youths begin the kuru dance. The old man and the listening villagers appear to be fully satisfied that they hear the voice of the deceased, and, indeed, it is regarded as essential, for failing the encouragement of a reply the gorukari could not go on."
482,"A number of people will have assembled to witness this formal reappearance of the widow, or doru. As so often on such occasions one and the same ceremony may suffice for a number of candidates, so that several doru who have been secluded in the neighbourhood may come out simultaneously. They are brought together in one house which is surrounded by a barricade of palm leaves. Here they are attended by a number of women and girls who spend the morning in decorating themselves behind the concealment of the barrier. Four men, who are to assist in the ceremony, also array themselves in full dancing-dress. Soon after midday, when the waiting spectators have already been entertained with a small feast, a few palm leaves are suddenly wrenched away, and in the gap there appear two of the men squatting on their heels and tapping their drums. Behind them is a long single file of kneeling women with two more men bringing up the rear. They all advance slowly, the women on their knees, the men shuffling on the soles of their feet. The doru, who wear their jackets of baja, are placed in the centre of the line. They cling to one another, or to the women in front of them, and are in turn supported by the women behind them. They wear a voluminous hood or cowl (pohu ) of bark-cloth embroidered with Job's Tears, and they hang their heads so that their faces are invisible. Having crawled forward in this manner for some twelve or fifteen yards they all rise to their feet, and, without increasing their pace, proceed to follow a semicircular course through the village. Then the four men withdraw, and the women sit down in a group on some palm leaves which have been laid ready. In their midst are the doru, their heads hung low, and their faces completely veiled with the pohu cowls. The whole ceremony is somewhat melancholy. The line moves very slowly, the doru dragging their feet and leaning heavily for support on the women in front of them. The spectators are seated in a wide half-moon, tapping drums very softly, and now and then intoning a solemn low-pitched ‘O _____, O _____!’ But this solemn performance may be succeeded by a dance, which of course gives a new complexion to the scene. On one such occasion which I witnessed, the dancers made their appearance somewhat prematurely, breaking cover at the edge of the village with an inspiring thunder of drums. One of the principals rushed forward dramatically waving them back, but, disregarding him, the dance swept into the village, while the solemn gorukari procession went steadily on. In this case the doru were helped on to a house verandah, and the younger girls in the procession turned hastily to join in the more animated and attractive entertainment of the dance. Throughout the rest of the day, which witnessed a dance, a dramatic performance, and a feast, the doru (of whom there were three) sat on the house verandah without as much as raising their heads to see what was going on."
483,"The singing, drum-beating, and feasting—not very exacting ceremonies—which constitute the chief ritual of the Taro cult, are together known as kasamba. At a large kasamba the scene is little different from that of the ordinary Orokaiva feast, except for a new style of singing, a certain exaggerated etiquette in the setting forth of the feast, and the excesses of those who lose control of themselves. Guest are given betel-nut and sit in an arc. Possibly a special platform or house, a sort of bandstand, has been erected for the occasion. This is called ba oro, i.e. ‘Taro men's house’, and is meant for the somewhat exclusive use of the accredited Taro men during the day, and for the chorus which is to continue throughout the night. The singers will crowd about a fire in the centre of the floor. The drums beat the distinctive Taro rhythm, viz. two equal beats followed by a pause equivalent to one of them, or time of three with the third beat missed. This rhythm, I believe, is used throughout the whole Division by the Taro singers, and, as far as I know, exclusively. It is the same rhythm as that of the dance baruga, practised long previous to the advent of Taro, save that it is considerably slower. Some sects perform a stationary and others a sort of processional dance. Some participants show signs of possession. They report that the sensations are felt in the stomach, the legs, and the head. A man made a stirring motion with his forefinger to give some idea of the revolving in his stomach, called peri peri. The real or supposed affection of the lower limbs is sufficiently evidenced by the lurching and reeling in which the Taro man so commonly indulges. Some men hear a strong buzzing in their ears so loud and distracting that they want to shout out. Others say that during the jipari they cannot see properly."
484,"A scene witnessed in the Aiga country is in many ways typical of the Taro cult, and in it we may see the medicine man at one of his characteristic tasks. A number of guests have assembled in the village of Totemaburari. The night and much of the forenoon have been spent in singing Taro songs, but still the revellers, whose endurance is greater than the jazzer's, show no signs of exhaustion. The principal Taro man, named Home, has been of late visited by his deceased father and has awoken to find a fresh supply of medicines in his hand. He now carries, strung together, a number of tiny packets, each neatly done up in a wrapping of green leaf, and each a very sizable mouthful. Upon close examination the packet proves to contain a somewhat repulsive hotchpotch, or rather salad, of five taro medicines, which have been already chewed with betel, spat out, and wrapped in the tidy, fair-seeming, little parcels to await a second chewing. At about noon Home, supported by two assistants who are like himself qualified Taro men, and attended by some twenty boisterous youths, sallies forth to perform the business of the day. This is nothing less than a wholesale medical treatment of the taro. Pushing rapidly through the garden, Home is seen to stoop and spray the medicines from his mouth over the taro leaves. He is continually tearing the husks from betel-nuts, which are necessary both to keep up his spirits and to ensure a suitably liquid medium for the ba sivo, and continually plies himself with the little green packets which contain the ba sivo itself. Here and there he pauses to break off some of the larger leaves (for the taros are well advanced and almost shoulder high). His two associates are similarly engaged, and meanwhile the chorus of young men, armed with their drums, are following or crowding around. The progress of the party is rapid and almost reckless: in reality the ceremony must conduce rather to the destruction than the growth of the taro, for the young drummers care little where they trample. The heat of the overhead sun is beyond endurance. The thirsty young men tear down bunches of sugar-cane and pounce upon the water-melons, regardless of their owners. One vociferous old woman stands in valiant defence of her melons, and a number of girls run on ahead to pluck their betel-pepper before the all-devouring chorus has reached it. But there is no lack of goodwill and merriment, and when, after almost two hours of this exceedingly strenuous employment, the Taro men return to the village, it is to partake of the feast which concludes almost every native ceremony"
485,"The treatment, however, which is specially associated with the Taro cult is that of drum-beating. The friends of a sick man will invite a number of Taro men to attend him. There is the invariable feast and probably a large concourse of more or less solicitous guests. They gather about the house of sickness and unite their voices in the songs of the kasamba to the continual thumping of drums. The patient may even lie in the midst of the group. It is surprising that a man in high fever should not be utterly distracted by the noise; but it is said that a native likes unpleasant medicine: he puts more faith in it. Various explanations are given of the efficacy of the kasamba and the drum. Some said that as they made the taro ‘get up quickly’, so they would make the sick man ‘get up quickly’. Apparently it was considered merely an enlivening process. I am informed that one magistrate, being overtaken by the fever, submitted himself by way of experiment to the attentions of the Taro doctor and ‘got up quickly’. Others, pointing out that the drum should be held close to the patient, explained that the taro spirit was enticed out of his suffering body into the hollow of the drum. After this the doctor should go to the gardens and beat his drum again, when the spirit, being liberated, would return to the taro. On the whole, however, we may rest assured that the drum is beaten and believed to benefit the long-enduring patient without any searching inquiry on the part of the drummer as to how it does so."
486,"This is another description of a ritual from the Taro Cult, but observed in an earlier period, when the cult was known as Kava-Keva. The ceremony, as I saw it, appeared to be controlled by Boninia. He invoked the presence of the “Spirit,” and, to the rhythmic drumming of the younger men, he shouted repeatedly Irie! Irie! (which are not Binandere words), and gradually worked himself up into a frenzy. The excitement of watching his efforts became too much for some of those present, and in a second or two several men and women became, like him, “possessed.” After the manner of drunken men they staggered through the village, falling over obstacles, bumping into trees and houses, their faces twitching and eyes rolling. They exhibited a stilted, jerky movement of arms and limbs and laboured respiration. With the palms of their hands outward, some shrieked, others sobbed, and many were silent. Those who were unaffected continued drumming and chanting in a low key the taro song which the “Spirit” had taught to Boninia. I noticed one of the drummers, who had previously been unvisited, gradually giving way to the feeling. He appeared at first to resist; but, after a short struggle, he displayed the symptoms of the “possession.” He staggered a few feet, and then fell to the ground in a fit. The other drummers encircled him, and, changing to quick time, moved round him singing an ordinary food song. At this stage Boninia revived automatically, and treated the boy with vigorous rubbing and slapping, calling repeatedly in his ear Do! do! do! At length the boy responded and was placed upright. He was kept moving in order to prevent a relapse threatened by his puffed face and stupefied manner. Then the elder men were treated by Boninia, and they in turn revived the others with similar treatment. All of them appeared strained and drowsy for hours afterwards. During the ceremony those who remained unaffected appeared to be ill at ease, and many of the women exhibited great concern at the behaviour of their children, particularly the mother of the boy “visited” for the first time. The boy told me that the “Spirit” had taught him, when in the fit, the names of certain charms to plant in his garden, and had given him other information which would be passed on as general knowledge to the cult. On a second occasion I saw another man “visited” for the first time, and the procedure was similar throughout."
487,"I witnessed the rites of Kekesi on November 26, 1914. They were performed with every appearance of sincerity and fanaticism. The man Yavevi conducted the ceremony, and seemed to be under the hypnotic influence of the man Bia, who remained throughout silent and carefully watching us. When the proceedings at all dragged, Bia would instil enthusiasm by throwing himself into a fit of convulsions from the waist upwards, jumping violently up and down while remaining in a sitting posture, and babbling unintelligibly, the saliva dropping from his mouth. In this condition he would be joined by Yavevi and some of the other men, whilst those remaining unaffected would redouble their efforts. Yavevi and Bia revived automatically, and Yavevi conducted the others through their prayer-like devotions. At the end of December the whole of the people of the Gira from the coast to Tabara and the Eia River in the west were performing the Kekesi rites as described above, with additional songs."
488,"The kava ceremony of the installation of the (King) Tu'i Kanokupolu, included 3 speeches, whilst doubtless an exhortation to the people to do their duty to the Tu'i Kanokupolu, are also an exhortation to the Tu'i Kanokupolu to do his duty in taking the fruits of the shore and sea to the Tu'i Tonga. Whilst the kava is being prepared Motu'apuaka and Lauaki dispute about who is to distribute it. Originally, it seems, there was a contention in real earnest, which was finally brought to the test of who (or whose son) had slain most men in a battle. In this Lauaki won the pre-eminence, but later gave the honour up to Motu'apuaka, who still holds it. The traditional dispute, however, is part of the ceremony. As the Queen moved onto the mala'e for her installation she was preceded by a man who ran ahead, brandishing a spear, crouching and looking round. His face was blackened, and he had the appearance of a scout or guard; but in his performance was a strong element of burlesque. The most extraordinary part of his behaviour was during the actual kava ceremony. He was free of all tapu, and his conduct, in other circumstances, would have been shockingly offensive. He smoked, lounged, and walked close before and behind the Queen's person, and when the pig's liver was placed before her he impaled it on his spear, and ate it."
489,"Kava to a travelling party. The root is brought and placed before the leader of the travelling party, or man of highest rank amongst them. He thanks the donors for their gift, picks it up, and puts it down again. The matapule of the highest chief present, whether he is one of the travellers or not, calls for the kava to be brought to him, and has the whole, or portion, prepared and drunk. The piece of root not being beaten up and brewed, or some other piece of kava, lies before the matapule the while. When one round has been drunk he orders the piece of kava lying before him to be taken to the matapule on the other side of the chief (in important kava ceremonies of all kinds the highest chief has a matapule on either hand, other chiefs present have but one). This matapule will then supervise a second round of drinking, using the liquor left in the bowl from the first round, if there be enough, or ordering the pieces already strained out to be beaten up and used again, or having a fresh piece of root prepared. If there be a third round the piece of root and supervision return to the first matapule, and so on. The passing of function from one matapule to the other is not confined to parties welcoming travelers. In any kava party the matapule may at the point when it is announced that the kava is clear, Kuo ma'a ae kava ni, give away the kava that is in front of him to anybody in the ring, to do what he likes with. Guests are frequently so honoured. The matapule says, Tauhi 'ae kava ni ma'a me'a, Take this kava for so-and-so; the person named, or his matapule, responds, Fakafetai, Thanks. Such a piece of kava is at the disposal of him to whom it is given; but if there be a shortage for the needs of present sociability he will probably have it beaten up and drunk."

491,"As the umbilical cord is snipped, the mother calls out: “Ko ho manava, mo hoku manava” —literally, “My breath and your breath.” The father takes the afterbirth with the cord attached and digs a hole in the middle of a path near the house. He burns some dry leaves in this hole to warm it and then, when the fire dies down, places the afterbirth in the hole after wrapping it in bark cloth. The hole is then carefully filled in with earth."
492,"After giving birth, the mother is confined for ten days.The mother's head is wrapped in a turban of bark cloth and she is covered with layers of bark cloth. Close to her lies the baby surrounded with an enclosure of bark cloth over which a piece of cotton or muslin is thrown to keep away flies. During the first day the father is busy preparing the feast for the mother's relatives. Inside the house in the public section and separated from the mother by the bark cloth partition, the mother's relatives congregate: three or four men and perhaps ten or twelve women. A girl makes kava while the group sits talking. A man comes into the house, throws a gift of kava onto the floor in the centre of the room and says: “Malo ae faele” —“Thank you for the child's birth.” All drink kava. Kava drinking and talking continue for the rest of the day."
493,"Relatives of the father do not visit during the early days of his wifres confinement but, toward the end of the ten-day period, they are formally invited by the father to visit the baby and mother. Food and kava are prepared for their visit."
494,"Special Kava ceremony associated with Wedding. All meet again at the groom's father's house where the gifts of mats and bark cloth have been piled high outside the house. On these mats are sitting the groom's mother's brother (his fa□e tangata, called at this time his fa□e huki, “lap mother”), and the bride's mother's younger sister. The groom sits in the lap of his mother's brother, the bride in the lap of her mother's sister. They continue to sit thus until the kava drinking is finished. Kava is made and drunk with special ceremony. The bowl is placed before the bride and groom. It is the largest possible bowl and in front of the bowl is the largest possible root of kava (kava toho. The kava and the accompanying food are provided by the fathers of both bride and groom. Four men out of the group of those present (termed collectively tou□a ) are selected to prepare the kava -root. The root is cut carefully into three sections. The middle section is laid aside because it brings bad luck to use it. From the two end pieces, the drink is prepared after these pieces have been scraped and cleaned. Two sets of pounding-stones are set on two mats and two men of the group of four slowly pound the kava root into small pieces. The groom invites an expert to make the kava. He sits before the bowl and prepares the drink from the root as it is passed to him by the pounders. The expert makes great display of skill as he goes through the routine of kava making. When the kava is ready, the person who is presiding over the circle calls for the kava -relish (fono kava). The largest pig (puaka toho) is divided in such fashion that the back is presented to the bride's father's sister's child (the bride's fahu ) and the remainder is divided equally among all the other members of the kava circle. Food from the oven is also divided among all those present. Neither pork nor other food may be eaten at this time. It is taken home and eaten after the kava -drinking is finished. Now the kava -cups are called and after the first round is finished the bride and groom leave the group."
495,"When the corpse reaches the cemetery, it is lowered into the grave. The undertaker gets into the grave also and arranges the mats and bark cloth round the body. He puts a large stone on top of the body to anchor it to the grave. Then he climbs out and the grave is filled in. There is singing and praying while this is being done. Finally the village overseer stands on the grave and makes a brief statement in which he urges the mourners to still their grief. He also announces the arrangements for the funeral feast and kava -drinking."
496,"A kava -circle is formed on an open space near to the mourners' house. The village overseer is invited to preside. On his left hand sits the undertaker and on his right sits the man who acts as attendant chief (matapule) to the village overseer. As the kava is being made, the ovens are opened. Then when the kava is clear and ready for drinking, the undertaker orders the food to be displayed. If special formality is desired, five stalks of sugar-cane are brought forward at this time. One stalk is placed before the overseer, two before the undertaker, and two before the attendant chief. The undertaker and the attendant each break their stalks into a sufficient number of pieces so that there is one piece for each of the men of the kava circle. This sugar cane then constitutes the kava -relish (fono ae kava). It is tapu to smoke tobacco at any time during this funeral celebration. The kava is now served. The undertaker receives the first cup. He pours the kava from the cup handed him into a special tapu cup that he carries with him. The other members drink from the cups provided for the circle. After one round of kava is finished, the undertaker makes a brief speech which runs as follows: “Thank you, O chiefly people, for coming to the funeral of this man. Now he rests quietly in his last resting-place. Tomorrow you will all gather together again. We shall finish this funeral on the morrow. We shall finish the work of making the deceased a chiefly person. Then everything will be finished as it should be. Now there is nothing more to do.” The references to chiefly people in these words are merely polite exaggerations indicating respect for the deceased and respect also for those present. They mean, “important people,” not people of noble rank, for none in this commoner village has any illusions over his ultimate status in this world."
497,"Early next morning, the family and its relatives go to the cemetery at dawn. The men clear away the weeds from the grave. The women go to the nearest beach, bring back clean sand and coral-pebbles to put on the grave. When this decorating work is finished, another feast is held. Uncooked food, generally ripe bananas, ripe plantains, sugar cane, melons, papaia, pineapples, bread, is collected together and placed in an open space near the cemetery. A kava -circle is formed with the undertaker presiding. Again, when the kava is clear and ready for serving, the undertaker orders the food to be divided. After one round, he makes a further speech of thanks to all those who have attended and helped with the decorating of the grave"
498,"Commencing with the night following the burial and for the following ten nights, there is a strict mourning-period (mohe or nofoaki putu) for all the close relatives of the deceased. Only the women sleep in the bereaved house. By day, men and women work bringing food from the bush to feed the group; part of each day is also spent carrying grave-pebbles and sand to further decorate the grave. On the tenth day, the close male relatives prepare a large feast to bring this mourning period to a close (fakamalele ae putu). The food is kept until nightfall when all the young boys and girls in the village, all the unmarried youth, that is, from puberty onwards, are invited to come to the deceased's house there to dance, sing and be joyful. The older people sit drinking kava and watching the fun. After the first making of the kava, the feast is divided among all present, young and old. The merry-making and kava -drinking continue until an early hour in the next morning. Then the people gather up their food-divisions and return home. The period of mourning is over. Relatives return to their own villages, if they have come from afar. The everyday life of the village can renew itself."
499,"After the church service (which those giving the feast may not attend because they are busy laying out the food), those attending the feast are seated according to rank along the feast table. At the head of the table sit the 'eiki of the congregation. This is the highest-ranking member of the congregation reckoned through the traditional political ranking system (that is through blood rank). This person may be male or female, in Ha'ano village two of the three church 'eiki are in fact female. The congregation minister, any high-ranking guests, and the malanga who gave the sermon regardless of his/her relative rank according to other ranking criteria. Below these people sit the other malanga and adult men, followed by adult women, and then younger men, women and children. Although food is relatively evenly distributed along the table, the very best foods are concentrated at the head of the table. Beyond the very bottom of the table is the ranking man of the feast-giving family, who sits beside a large basket of food which will be given to the malang at the end of the feast. The rest of the feast givers are arranged outside of the lower end of the table and will not eat until after the feast is formally concluded. The feast begins with a prayer of thanksgiving and a blessing of the food. People then eat while they listen to the speeches which follow. The first speech is given by the ranking man of the feast givers, who welcomes people, apologizes for the poor food (again this food is not “poor”), and then explains the reason for the feast. At this level the “reason” is not directly linked to the particular church event, but rather the person or persons within the feast-giving group for whom the feast is offered. Feasts motivated by the Church calendar are given to God, but also for some member or members of the feast-giving group. This is usually, but not always, a child. Both feasting activity focused on life crisis events, and those described here that arise in association with the Churches, have at their centre some individual or individuals. The speaker asks that the congregation recognize the humble feast offered by asking God to bless the child and family, and to bring them good things (success in an examination at school, good health, etc.). Subsequent speakers take up this request by speaking of the feast givers' laudable actions and devotion to family and community as is evidenced by the feast. They then ask God to help the family in the future. The speakers are generally (but not always) other malanga or respected adult men. The highest ranking persons speak last. Usually it is the malanga who offers the final prayer. Where earlier speeches may have an oblique element to them, the final prayer includes a direct request to God for assistance to the feast-giving family."
500,"Nahanamu ritual. Involves a 4 day preparatory phase where they set aside one large basket, uhu aru anamu, holding some 75 kg. of yuruma, each day. There is a break of two months, until the shaman has a certain dream. On the long anticipated night of the Nahanamu the people dance until dawn. Meanwhile, the religious office holders (wisimo) sing the whole night in the temple hut giving tobacco to the kanobo. The dance is led by some of the lesser religious office holders who play the sacred rattle (hebu mataro) and the isimoi trumpet. At dawn the yuruma flour is distributed among the households and the invited guests. First, the aidamotuma are given a regular uhu basket of some 25–30 kg. The other families receive somewhat less. Now start the dances of the nahanamu proper. The sequence in which the dancers perform is of great political importance, because it establishes the power ranking and prestige of office holders for the remainder of the year. After the dances of the elders, the workers involved in the extraction of yuruma dance. This is an important confirmation of their standing in the community. First is the “dance of the akabatu, ” the household heads, who acted as “moriche fellers.” The “dance of the anahurumu ” follows. This is the dance of the nebu who chopped the pith of the palm with the wooden adze and extracted the pulp (deho). Finally comes the “dance of the anamumo, ” the women who sifted and processed the pulp. After a series of games, in which various animals are imitated, comes the wayabatu. In this dance the women jokingly attack whichever male is carrying the rattle, pretending to hit him hard with their fists and to tear out his penis. This is the last part of the nahanamu dances proper, and it finishes the cycle. After this dance follows another animal game, this time not confined to the dancing platform but ranging over the whole settlement: the “representation of the wild pig” (ebure sitakitane). By now it is late afternoon and the wisiratu formally closes the festivities by loosing two arrows into the sky (hatabu kuai eburukitane). These arrows are the two daunona staffs. The young men scramble to catch the falling arrows, and carry them off to the temple."
501,"The habi sanuka, or festival of the “small rattles,” is a ritual in its own right. It is described by Barral (1957:104) as a theurgic dance, which, celebrated separately, involves a communal meal and the distribution of food. The ceremony involves the eating of tortillas of moriche starch or, significantly, bitter manioc. Like the uida, the habi sanuka generally has a sponsor, a lesser shaman, but nevertheless a man of considerable political standing, who presides over the distribution of the food. At least two large basketfuls (approximately 150 kg.) of flour are required. The flour for the habi sanuka is sometimes stored for up to a month, but only in the original baskets, and not in a nahanamu container, where it could be preserved longer"
502,"Initiation as wisidatu, shaman. The initiation trial consists of isolation for some five to seven days in the kanobo house. During this period the apprentice fasts and smokes a great number of cigarettes wina. The smoke and lack of nourishment cause the neophyte to have hallucinations. They describe the appearance of some dead relative or of any other Warao and indicate this as hebu. The hallucination accounts vary with the individual and his own personal experience. However, all agree in attributing to the revelation of hebu a human appearance. The cigarette wina is the vehicle which transmits the condition of wisidatu from the master to the apprentice. The Warao wisidatu are carriers of hebu in their bodily structure. All, at the moment of initiation, have received, within their chests, hebu from the chest of the master. The passage of hebu from the chest of the master to that of the apprentice is effected in the following manner: the apprentice prepares a cigarette which he gives to the wisidatu, and the latter lights it and smokes. The fire of hebu is obtained especially by rubbing together two twigs of himaheru (M alouetia tamaquarina ). When the wisidatu smokes, he introduces hebu from his chest into the cigarette, following which, at the culminating moment of the wisidatu's initiation, the apprentice takes a turn at smoking, thus acquiring in his own chest hebu from the master. To the acquiring of hebu into the corporeal structure of the initiate is added the habit of constantly smoking innumerable wina. The young apprentice is also trained to control his diaphragm and his breathing in order to produce the snoring sounds characteristic in communication with hebu. Finally, the apprentice is instructed in hebu vocabulary, incomprehensible to the ordinary Warao. The soundness of the knowledge acquired by the wisidatu initiate depends on the number of teachers who take part in his instruction. When he has several teachers, the apprentice receives hebu from the chest of each one of them, for which reason his condition as a specialist in hebu is strengthened"
503,"The steps followed by the wisidatu in the development of his treatment have, thus, been as follows: 1. Preliminary preparations. 2. Invocation of auxiliary hebu. 3. Possession of the wisidatu and of the rattle by auxiliary hebu. 4. Dialogue between auxiliary hebu and the Warao helper. 5. Possession of the wisidatu by hebu -sickness. 6. Dialogue between hebu -sickness and the Warao helper. 7. Identification of hebu -sickness. 8. Extraction of hebu -sickness from the body of the patient by means of the rattle and its expulsion out of the settlement. The wisidatu smokes continuously throughout these proceedings and utters guttural noises when possessed"
504,"A puberty ceremony for a girl takes place on the occasion of her first menstruation at the age of twelve or thirteen. She is secluded in the menstruation hut (nowadays it is more often a special corner reserved for this purpose in the dwelling house), where she must not leave her hammock on her own or touch her feet to the ground under any circumstances. Twice daily a man and woman—a couple unrelated to her but referred to as step-parents—appear to carry the child to a special seat outside the house. The women of the village pour water over her as she sits; this is believed to ensure fertility. She must observe silence for three days, and her sole diet consists of the traditional “true” food: yuruma and morocoto fish. She may drink water. Her hair is cropped, gathered in a basket, and buried. This is supposed not only to guarantee uncomplicated deliveries in the future, but also to forestall the premature sickening and death of the girl's parents. Her back is painted in geometrical designs, circles, and Saint Andrew's crosses. She is given a glass-bead necklace by her parents, to be worn from that day on, and is considered a marriageable young woman."
505,"Wedding; preliminary ceremonies. They spread out a white cloth in the direction of Mecca, on the end of the cloth they place a mirror (“the mirror of happiness”) sent by the future husband, and beside the mirror they place two candlesticks in which they light a candle in the name of the future husband and a candle in the name of the bride. After scattering a handful of wheat in front of the mirror, the women throw a quilted cloth (souzani) over it. Then they light a lamp made of honey and oil and cover it with an overturned basin. On the basin they place a horse's saddle, and the future bride sits there turned towards Mecca. A veil of red cottonstuff is made ready, together with seven small nails. The cottonstuff is spread out on the floor, and a hammer obtained. One of the women chants the chapter Yasin (No. 36) 67 of the Koran. Each time she encounters the letter s (sin), another woman drives a nail into the cottonstuff with a single blow, in such a manner that the last nail driven coincides with seven s's. Then the carpet is put back in place and sprinkled with salt (namak), so that the bride will appear pleasing (banamak) to her husband. A cloth called souzani (“quilted”) is spread on top, and on this an earthenware oil lamp (geli; mousi) is lighted. A copper basin is placed upside-down over the lamp, and the basin supports a saddle which is itself covered with a napkin or a white cloth. Water from a bowl is sprinkled over the bride's head and the candles are extinguished with her shoes.Then the two mullahs who represent the bride and groom are brought in. They are accompanied by witnesses chosen from the close relatives of the girl (who stays in the next room or hides behind a curtain). Addressing her without seeing her, one of the mullahs asks her if she consents to the marriage. To demonstrate her modesty, she answers yes after a great deal of reticence. While the mullah delivers his allocution (hotbe), the bride reads a few verses from the Koran (chapter of Joseph, No. 12) in order to encourage reciprocal love between the bride and groom. They conclude by saying “May that be blessed!” (mobarek bad). And the women begin to shout for joy. The loaves of sugar which have been rubbed together over the bride's head are taken to the husband, and he presents a gratuity to the bearer. There are sweets and fruit in the room where the guests are waiting. As soon as the mullahs enter this room after concluding their office, everyone begins to eat. The remains are given to the servants, but several women take some away with them, for this food stimulates good luck. Then one of the bride's close relatives introduces the groom. He is made to sit next to her, and looks at her reflection in a mirror while wild rue is burned. Close relatives and intimates of the bride and groom throw handfuls of sugared almonds (noql) on their heads, together with coins for which the other women push and shove one another to retrieve. In order to solemnize his first glance at his wife, the husband gives her a present called rou-nema (“unveiling”; generally a jewel). A few moments later he withdraws. The wedding is celebrated either immediately, or else a few weeks and sometimes even a few years later"
506,"The hatm, this word (which means the complete chanting of the Koran) designates a ceremony which is arranged on the day after a death (or at least within the three days after) in the home of the deceased In the middle of a large room. These are surrounded by small crystal flagons (golab-pas) filled with rose-water (golab). On a corner of the shawl is placed a chest containing a Koran written in separate notebooks, each of the latter being a djoz (one-thirtieth of the whole). This kind of Koran is called si-pare or si-djoz (“in thirty parts”). Korans are also found in sixty half-parts, called sast-pare. The copy used in the hatm is a waqf (pious endowment) legacy left to the inhabitants of the city or neighborhood by a devout person. It is kept in the mosque and is generally a beautiful manuscript, often an old one. Near the manuscript is placed a Koran-repository (rahl), into which some of the notebooks are put. When the dead person is young (man or woman), a candle painted black is supposed to burn in the middle of the room until it goes out. At the far end of the room sit two or three Koran readers, who take turns chanting for hours at a time. A man dressed as a mullah stands in the middle of the room, behind the spread-out shawl. To each newcomer he cries out the word “fatehe,” draws near him and on his hands pours rosewater with which the visitor must rub his face. A cup of coffee without sugar is served to the visitors, and they are presented with one of the notebooks of the Koran which they read in an undertone. Then follows a cup of tea. At noon all the persons present stay for lunch, which is served on a cloth spread on the floor in another room. Men of distinction withdraw, so as to avoid eating what is offered in the name of a dead person, but relatives of the deceased must take part in this meal. In the afternoon, the hatm resumes until sunset. Early the next morning the ceremony may begin again, but it never lasts more than two days (generally half a day or one day). In order to conclude, recourse is had to an important personage who comes and declares that it is time to adjourn. This duty is called “picking up the hatm,” that is to say picking up the shawl. When he arrives, the personage invites the Koran readers to stop (“hatm-ra djam' konid”). One of them then recites the chapter (sura) No. 55 (ar-rahman), while the others repeat in chorus the verses which should be repeated. Then a preacher (va'ezh) mounts into the pulpit (or onto a chair) and delivers the deceased's funeral oration, followed by a recital of the martyrdom of Kerbela, which is an example to emulate. He concludes as he would in a rowzehani meeting , and everyone leaves."
507,"Sacrifice of a Camel. Until recent times the animal was adorned and decorated like the sheep (kohl, shawl, mirror) and solemnly presented to the sovereign on the eve of the holiday by the chief camel-keeper of the Court (rais-e sotor-hane, chief of the service of transports by camel). The sovereign then gave permission for the sacrifice. The next day there was a great procession composed of all the valets (ferras) and runners (sater) in ceremonial dress. Representatives of each trade were mounted on ornamented mules, with military music and drummers leading the procession. A great personage (formerly, one who belonged to a younger branch of the Qadjar) was designated to preside over the sacrifice (sah-e sotor-qorbani). Mounted on a horse (with its tail dyed red—the distinctive mark of horses belonging to the crown), he wore a red uniform (1 1. “He will be rewarded with a robe of honor (khalst) and a superb gift, and for a few hours will hold the illusory title of king, like the person in our own land who gets the bean on Epiphany day” (Bricteux, Pays, p. 67).). The place of sacrifice, always the same, was the Maidan Sepah (Square of Arms). It used formerly to be before the Beharestan palace. When the camel had been sacrificed at the order of the king for the day (formerly by the royal executioner), the parts of its body were distributed to the representatives of the various trades according to their profession (the feet to the shoeing-smith, the back to the saddler and the head to the vendor of sheep's heads—kellepez). It was thought that eating the meat rekindled one's faith."
508,"The sacrifice for the sick. First this prayer is repeated, “O God, this lamb which you have given me is for you. I sacrifice it for your servant. Accept the meat of it for his flesh and the blood of it for his blood; and, O God, accept it as you accepted. Abraham's sacrifice.” The slayer then blows into the lamb's ear, the takbír (“God is Great”) is repeated three times, “In the Name of God” is said three times, and the victim is killed. The place of the sacrifice must be “under the sky,” a place that is clean and not too near where people pass,"
509,"Rowze-hani ritual occurs during the 3-20 day commemoration and mourning for commemorating the death of the imam Hussein. Rowze-hani occurs in a courtyard covered in a tent or mosque. The walls are hung with black as is the pulpit. The rowze-han begins with a poem of a religious character. He next recounts an episode taken from the history of the Shiite holy family, then declaims another poem. If he is accompanied by his children, the latter sit on the last step of the pulpit and chant the first and final poems together with their father. Inferior to the rowze-han is the meddah (panegyrist). Garbed like a dervish, he stands in front of the pulpit and recites a long martsiye [thrène —Translator] composed by himself or by a classic author. The most eminent of the three is the va'ezh (preacher). He regularly begins with a theological or moral sermon and ends with a thrène. When the last officiant has finished, all those present raise their hands towards heaven (palms in the air and joined at the wrists). The officiant invokes the divine blessing on the whole land, and in particular on the people present and on the reigning sovereign. Then all rise and one of the persons present recites the ziyaret-name. Turning first towards Mecca (and everyone imitates him), he addresses an oration to the imam Hussein; turning towards Meshed, he addresses an oration to the imam Riza; then turning again towards Mecca, he salutes Mahdi (the hidden imam). After this meeting is over. The master of the house, who is seated facing the pulpit as the last officiant occupies it, shows him his hands joined to make a hollow in order to notify him thereof. The officiants are paid as they leave this last meeting (an average of five tomans altogether). For this purpose, the master of the house stands before the door and delivers a sealed envelope to each of them, as well as to the children and servants accompanying them. A few persons of distinction give a coin to each of the people present."
510,"The Procession of the Tenth Day (Achoura) during the commemoration and mourning of imam Hussien. A large procession in Tehran with trumpets, horses, flags, fanfare, people dressed as if they had come from a war (wth daggers and arrows in chest) and lastly the breast flagellants, flagellants with a chain and flagellants with a sword. In Teheran, the processions from the various quarters and even from the suburbs marched through the streets and ended at the bazaar (by reason of the mosques located there). On the day of Achoura, the Green Market (sebz maidan) was invaded by the mob. On the Chems-ol-emare square a platform was erected for the sovereign and great personages. In front of the platform there were tents filled with women and children representing Hussein's family. At noon (the time of the imam's murder) the processions concentrated there (the various quarters used to compete to see whose procession could be the most sumptuous). Every year disputes of precedence broke out, and sometimes blood flowed."
511,"On an auspicious day, a father arrives at the monastery with his son. The boy presents to his master lama the traditional scarf of felicity, a couple of packets of Chinese noodles, and prostrates himself nine times. The boy receives the name of his master, for lamas are not supposed to have any family. The adoption is finished, master and novice constitute one family, and the boy will obey his master as he obeyed his parents. By this ceremony, which is a real adoption, the novice is constituted the legal heir of the fortune of his master, who usually possesses a home or a small courtyard inside the monastery, some animals, and money. The novice will stay with and serve his master his whole life, the master caring for his subsistence, keep, and education."
512,"First vows. After a few days, on a new auspicious day, the ceremony of the taking of the first vows is performed. In the early morning, the master himself shaves the head of his pupil. It is said that a layman is not allowed to be present at that moment. Five Gelüng lamas arrive; one of them sits against the wall of the k'ang, and the other four, in pairs, sit opposite each other. The kneeling novice holds incense sticks in his hands and the Gelüng starts the ceremonial prayers, reciting the thirteen traditional vows which the novice repeats after him. Nine prostrations are given before a picture of some Buddha, and the chief of the Gelüngs makes a speech. The boy thanks the Gelüng and his master by prostrations, and the vows are taken. From that time on the boy is called. In some monasteries only two Gelüngs preside over the ceremony; at Seerkok, only one. The master then enters the name of his pupil in the roster of inmates of the monastery. The master alone is the judge of the aptitude and religious vocation of his pupil."
513,"At the age of eighteen the novice takes his second vows and is called Gelüng. According to the rules, the vows are only allowed to be taken at the age of twenty, but at eighteen, one year is added for his father and one for his mother, and the required twenty years are complete. The ritual for the taking of the second vows, which number 253, is the same as for the taking of the first vows. A minor Living Buddha or a Fa-t'ai is invited to preside over the ceremony, after which an official religious name is given to the novice. The family and friends of the novice are invited to attend this important rite and they bring gifts with them, such as meat, rice, raisins, jujubes, Chinese noodles, rolls. A dinner is served, and each of the guests upon leaving for home receives two rolls from the novice. The taking of the 253 vows is the highest rung of the ladder of Lamaist dignities reached by 99 out of 100 lamas in Huang-chung. Although the appellation of “lama” is officially reserved for monks who have passed this stage, in Huang-chung it is commonly used for all monks who have taken the second vows, and usually indiscriminately for all people who wear the lama clothing"
514,"Honouring the five chief spirits. On an auspicious day fixed by a lama, usually of the Red Sect, at the end of the fifth moon, and usually during the sixth moon, five delegates from every village in an area are sent to the mountain. They carry a tent and drive some sheep which have been washed and combed, with red paper pasted on their horns and ribbons attached to their fleece, and a piece of red cloth eight feet long on each of their backs. The men also bring some spears and arrows painted red and black, miniature bows, firecrackers and the famous “precious bottle” (the urn). The first day, at evening, all the representatives of the villages pitch their tents at the foot of the celebrated mountain and pass the night in merrymaking. The next day, being the auspicious day, in the early morning the chief and the elders of the village, with a large crowd of villagers, arrive to attend the rites to be celebrated on top of the mountain. Chinese merchants pitch tents and do business at the foot of the mountain. After breakfast all the chiefs of the villages with the villagers go to the Obo. One group after another sets off firecrackers before the Obo, plants in the stone heap spears and arrows, and attaches new flags and pieces of wool and bones, and reverently bury their precious bottle in a deep hole. On the crude offering table, the killed sheep is offered, broth is thrown first toward “Heaven” and then to the four points of the compass for “all the spirits,” the famous Wei-sang rite is performed and libation made, while the groups kneel and prostrate themselves. After the rites of each village are performed by the chiefs, a group of lamas, mostly of the Red Church, perform on behalf of the entire community a big Wei-sang rite, beating drums, blowing horns, and chanting some prayers; they all turn three times around the obo. In the afternoon at the foot of the mountain an immense crowd of men and women enjoy the horseraces and the wrestling. singing and drinking. At sunset most of the people leave, but groups of young folk pass the night around the tents, merrymaking. On the morning of the third day, the tents are rolled up, all the people leave, and the spirit of the mountain enjoys in undisturbed silence his ownership over the country."
515,"It has been noted that in many villages an additional temple besides the community temple, had been built and dedicated by zealous villagers to a Buddhist deity. Every year, in summertime, some lamas, very often of the Red Sect, are invited to perform the rite of the Om Mani. Butter, flour of roasted spelt, and tea are collected among the villagers. The lamas prepare the tormas, the cups with water, spices and flowers, the lamps, recite texts, beat drums, ring bells. After the texts are recited the villagers start to make the thousand circumambulations around the temple, saying “Om Mani,” spinning the prayer wheels, and moving from east to west in the ritual way. Old and young are keenly interested in the practice and all help to perform the thousand turns. Three lamas sit on a woolen carpet outside the temple, noting the number of turns performed by each villager who comes to have his merits noted. It is a busy day for the lama accountants. It is an interesting rite, performed in high spirits by the whole community. Youngsters run around the temple, competing in speed, praying “Om Mani” while old people walk, absorbed in devotion"
516,"Another quite different Om Mani rite is enacted six times a year by older people, mostly women, members of an Om Mani society, which has a small fund for securing tea and rolls for the devotees. It consists of circumambulations around a Bumkhang, and the turning of prayer wheels, but in a west to east direction. The number of circumambulations is not fixed. All day long the moving devotees go on continuously. At least one lady has to be on the way at all times saying “Om Mani.” At the time of calamities the whole population performs the rite."
517,"On the floor before the kang of the hutukhtu a felt mat is spread and the little torma is put on it. The person to be consecrated enters, followed by the mother's brother and his children, kneels barefoot and bareheaded (the women without a headdress and with their braids hanging down) on the mat, kowtows three times, and remains kneeling before the torma. The hutukhtu prays over the candidate for consecration. The latter holds out his cupped hands, into which the hutukhtu pours holy water from his can. He drinks it. There follows a second pouring into the cupped hands. The candidate for consecration rinses his mouth with it and spits the water twice over the torma. He washes his head with the third portion of water poured into his cupped hands. Finally the last pouring follows, with which he washes his face. After that the hutukhtu sprinkles him with holy water from the can and throws Tibetan barley over him, on which he has blown three times. He consecrates the water with the spices in advance, after the tormas are finished. For the sprinkling he uses the peacock feather, not a twig from the tree of life. Now the master of ceremonies, the husbands of the daughters, and children take the torma that stands before the candidate out into the yard and throw it away. The mother's brother stays there, and after that only own children still appear. They stand or kneel in the side room behind the person to be consecrated and shut the door, because only a few people may be present. Only the person to be consecrated remains in the lama-room, kneeling before the kang. The candidate for consecration now washes himself again in the manner described above, is again sprinkled with holy water, and has Tibetan barley thrown at him. The master of ceremonies takes an iron spoon, puts in it some of the red-hot material from the fire-basin of the lama, scatters pounded cypress incense on it, and the lama throws fragrant spices over it. The person to be consecrated is fumigated all around with this and is now completely pure. The hutukhtu gives the consecration prayer over him and instructs him regarding the commandments that he must observe from now on. These commandments relate to fasting, abstention, the prohibition against killing, prayer, etc. They vary somewhat for men and women. The instruction is given in the Tujen language so that the candidate will understand it. Now follows the donning of the yellow sash. It is about a hand wide and four to five ells long."
518,"Rites concerning the guardians of wealth. Five lamas enact the rite, which lasts for seven days. The first day, helped by a carpenter, they build a rudimentary sedan chair with thin lathes, and paste on it plenty of colored paper. Four flags are set up, one on each of the four corners. In the sedan chair are deposited five small paper bags, each containing a handful of five kinds of grain, five kinds of thread of the five sacred colors, some packets of wool, some rolls, white and red sugar, raisins, dried apricots, some meat and some new garments of the very cheapest kind. The sedan chair is placed in the center of the living room. In front of it, in the courtyard, an enormous bull head made of paper and having two terrifying horns painted red is put in a large caldron. A lamp is lit before the caldron. A piece of black cloth about two feet wide is stretched in a square around the caldron and sedan chair and is supposed to represent the wall of a city. An opening is left where the cloth meets and is called the city gate. Outside the city walls are planted painted spears and swords, one next to the other. In front of the city gate a stake is planted on which cabalistic designs are written with red ink. The stake is supposed to be the seat of the spirit who is the avenger of injustices. The lamas, twice every day, sit in front of the stake, ringing bells, rattling drums, manipulating the ritual daggers, and reciting texts. Absorbed in meditation, they stare for a long time at the stake. Finally, they start imploring the spirit not to release its avenging bolts, inviting it to take a look at the magnificent sedan chair upholstered with satin and brocade and adorned with silk flags, to look at the hundreds of measures of grain put into the chair, the hundreds of pounds of sugar and raisins, the hundreds of rich garments, and the herd of sheep which follows the chair (for the few pieces of meat are called a “herd of sheep”), and so on, for the other items. They implore it to look at the unusual prodigality of the customer, who is a fervent adherent of the faith. After the parody is played, the lamas have a good time visiting the neighbors. On the seventh day, at night, all the neighbors help escort the troublesome spirit outside the village, forming an imposing cortege with banners flying and drums, horns, and some rifles, and carrying the sedan chair, the caldron and bull head, the spears and swords. The lamas blow the trumpets made from a human femur. The bull head, spears, and swords are buried in a deep hole; a big fire is lit and the pit is filled, at full speed, flush with the ground. The stake is thrust into it; the whole group howls and curses the avenger, rifles are fired, trumpets blown, and the lamas return. The sedan chair is emptied by the neighbors. Restitution is thus made, the avenging spirit is appeased and thrust into the hole, and the thief remains possessor of his thievery"
519,"Rite of the White Tiger, It is performed in May, before the time of the hailstorms. The original and complete rite is not enacted every year. the shamans arrive, clothed in the black gown; the chief of the shamans alone wears the flowery coat. All the shamans wear the black cap with long tail. After sunset the villagers arrive and the temple is closed tightly. A hog and a sheep are offered, while the attendants prostrate themselves, holding incense sticks, and the shamans dance and beat drums. In the deepest silence, they go to the place prepared for the rite, holding banners. All the heterogeneous items required are loaded into a cart. A hole fifteen feet in depth has been dug beforehand. Its upper part is shaped in a circle, the middle part is square, and the lowest part triangular. The chief of the shamans descends into the pit alone. His whole body is enveloped in red cloth; he wears a cincture made of hemp, such as the people wear at funerals. Holding in his hands the whip and the ritual knife, he takes off his shoes and hose and puts on shoes made from hemp ropes. His pigtail is unplaited, and his hair disheveled. Some youngsters, their heads enveloped in a red cloth, descend with him into the pit. They communicate by signs and tokens, for it is forbidden to utter a single word inside the pit. The shamans beat the drums outside the pit. In the center of the triangle one of the biggest jars is deposited, inside of which are put the corpse of the baby or boy, and the different sorts of earth. All items are covered with a piece of red cloth and the kettle is inverted over them. The chain is wrapped around the jar and fastened with the lock. The pair of trousers, the skeleton, bones and skulls are deposited around the jar, with the living snake enclosed in a basket. The triangle is filled with earth, level with the base of the square. Then five stakes are fixed in the earth, and bowls, eggs, bricks, tiles, lions and hand mills are put around them. In the midst are erected the threshing rolls, on which is put the millstone, in the center of which is fixed a stake to support the cart wheel, to which the planks are nailed; the interspaces are filled with the remaining items. The whole is covered with boughs, and the pit is filled with earth level with the ground. The attendants start howling like madmen, jumping and leaping around the pit in the pitch dark night, brandishing banners, while shamans dance, and beat drums and cymbals. The cart axle, sharpened to a stake, is fixed in the earth upon the pit; on it is written “Throne of the White Tiger.” Some bowls placed upside down and bricks and tiles are put around the stake and the tiger; four more stakes are fixed in the ground according to the four points of the compass, and a mound is erected upon the pit. Next to the mound is placed a big wooden box containing the living white dog; a small mound is erected upon it so that the dog may see the light and breathe air through a hole. The dog will live for some days; it will howl and finally die. On the other side of the big mound is erected a similar small mound, opposite the dog's mound, in which is entombed the living cock in a box. It will live and die under the same circumstances as the dog. When the rite is completed all the participants face the northwest, the direction from which the hailstorms usually come, and throw stones at the evil spirits, howling like madmen, uttering the most obscene threats, and taking the wildest aggressive attitudes, while the shamans crack their whips and dance a threatening dance, conjuring the evil spirit in wild gyrations. The wild act is performed three times. On the spot a big fire is lit with cypress boughs, and all the attendants, shamans included, jump over it in order that the evil spirits may no longer follow them, and in order to get purified. After a last dance in the temple yard, the whole audience enjoy themselves, making fun, eating the pork and mutton, and drinking plenty of wine."
520,"Procession with sacred books. A chief is appointed for the performance of the rite. He goes, with 108 men of the village, to the lamasery to borrow the books. The village defrays the expenses of a collation of butter tea with tsamba for the lamas, and a fixed amount of butter to be burned in the lamps before the Buddha statues in the temple. The next morning the procession starts from the village temple with at least one member from each family. The ritual cypress offering, Wei-sang, is first performed in the temple. A shaman, or lama of the Red Sect, summons into his staff the spirits who predict the success and the opportuneness of the rite. He steps to the head of the procession with the spirit-laden staff, followed by a group of horn blowers and banner and drum bearers. Then come the statue of the temple, enthroned in the sedan chair, the table and stake gods, and the bearers of the heavy books, one after another, while the music plays, and Om Mani prayers are devoutly recited the whole way. The procession tours around the limits of the extensive village lands, making stops on the highest mountains or most elevated spots, where the ritual cypress burning is done and where the whole group walks three times around the spot. When they return to the temple the ritual cypress offering closes the ceremony. The procession usually lasts for a whole day. The next day the books are returned to the monastery. The procession involves the whole male population of the village. The bearing of Buddhist books is said to be very effective, as are the praying of Om Mani, the offering of tea to the lamas and of butter for the lamps, and the shamanist spirit-laden staff, the table and stake gods, and all the other Taoist statues of the temple which tour the village at the same time. All available heterogenous forces contribute to the success of this specifically Buddhist rite. Usually this procession with the books is performed every other year; in the intervening year it is performed without the books."
521,"Bulls and he-goats are always consecrated by the chiefs of the communities in the temple yard of the village, on the third day of the New Year, to the guardian deity of the village, never to “Heaven,” for no temples are dedicated to heaven. The ceremony is attended by a member from each family. The animal is cleansed, smoked, washed and combed in the courtyard, then led before the open door of the temple in front of the statue or picture of the guardian deity of the village. The chief of the village pours milk mixed with water, while all the participants kneel, holding incense sticks in their hands. The animal shakes its head, and ribbons are attached and red paper is pasted on the horns. Every year the animal must be presented to the deity in the temple on the third of the New Year. It is a quite dangerous and difficult job, assigned to the youngsters of the village, who wash and comb the savage bull."
522,"Frist Day. The shamans, wearing the black gown, flower-decorated silk coat, and the crown of the god of the Five Roads, stand erect before the pole and start beating the drums. The villagers prostrate themselves nine times toward the pole, in time with the command of the chief of the village, holding incense sticks in joined hands, and sit on their heels waiting. The elders sit in the first rows. The shamans start dancing before the pole, keeping time with the beating of the drums and cymbals; they become more and more excited, when all of a sudden their chief points at the rope fixed on top of the roof of the entrance gate and cries: “Here they are, the Twelve Tengris!” and continuing to point at the rope, he follows them with his finger and eyes, just as if he were seeing the spirits climbing along the rope that reaches to the top of the pole. He grasps the end of the rope lying on the table, and runs with it, straight to the throne (sheet of red paper on the wall) prepared for the Twelve Tengris and their leader. He holds reverently the end of the rope against the throne, so that the spirits may step unhurt onto the throne. The other shamans and the apprentices run to the throne and prostrate themselves; the whole audience prostrates itself with incense sticks in the hands and the chief shaman starts greeting the spirits: “We are so glad to honor you”—and the audience repeats each time the words of the shamans and prostrates itself—“You must be tired from the long journey…. It is kind of you to have come so far…. We are very happy to honor you. …” Then follows the next act—making the spirits propitious and well disposed (nan shen ). The shamans and the apprentices kneel in rows before the pole, with incense sticks in their joined hands in the same way as the audience. It is the most important and enjoyed moment of the day. It reveals the peculiar, but typical, religious frame of mind of shamans and Monguors. In the deepest and most solemn silence, the chief of the shamans starts talking with the spirits. He gives a detailed account of all the offerings displayed on the table and before the thrones of the gods—sheep, pig. During the talk of the shaman, the people repeat his words while prostrating themselves. Some among the shamans really have the knack of saying things that go to the marrow of the bones. Such shamans are always invited, and are beloved by the people. Their talk is long or short, according to the inspiration of the moment and the circumstances, and at that moment the audience is in a really prayerful mood. After the speech, all the shamans start their most gracious dance, honoring the kind spirits. Then for a long, long while the shamans sit down. They beat the drums softly, and the chief shaman, the whole time listening to his drum, makes the statement in stereotyped terms that “The gods just finished their council and have decided that during the three summer months, the crops will be protected against hail and the village will enjoy peace. The gods have decided that during the three winter months the people and the herds will enjoy peace and be preserved from illnesses. It has been decided by the gods and the decision is irreversible.” The people prostrate themselves thankfully, repeating: “Irreversible.” Then the chief shaman gives them an account of all the offerings deposited before them by their descendants. He invites them to taste the offerings and to enjoy them, repeating several times that the descendants are happy to be in their presence and the attendants repeat his words. Finally a last dance is performed before the pole, prostrations are made, and the attendants leave the temple. By then the sun is setting, the gathering having lasted a whole day."
523,"(1) possession by the White Tiger spirit, which involves extended acrobatic dancing ending with one shaman becoming possessed by the White Tiger. With his whole body writhing he cuts his arm with a razor, making it bleed. The women rush to the shaman and apply paper to the wound. These papers are efficacious talismans for the protection of children, and are sewn on their clothes by their mothers."
524,"(2) the greeting of the Goddess of Joy; on the large threshing floor of the village is placed a table with offerings. The villagers sit around the edges of the floor in order that the shaman may have room for the performance and the evolutions. All the shamans wear the black cap with long tail, and keeping time with the beating of drums and cymbals perform their wildest dances for a long time. Usually three or four among them seem to be possessed. All of a sudden the chief of the shamans becomes excited to fever pitch, and howls “go to the goddess.” Then, followed by the other shamans, he grasps a chicken and, dancing with fury, bites its neck and jerks off its head in a wild movement. Grimacing with distorted face, and glittering eyes, he throws the bleeding chicken head in the supposed direction of the goddess, uttering dreary cries and indistinct sounds. After the rite is accomplished, the people go home for dinner."
525,"(3) leave-taking of the spirits, the chief of the shamans makes preparations for the leave-taking of the spirits. The shamans perform a dance, while the audience kneels. The shaman again enjoins the people to ask for benedictions. He has a last talk with the spirits, thanks them for the visit, reminding them of their promises, and invites them ceremoniously, one after another, to return to their splendid abodes calling them by the most pompous titles. Firecrackers are set off, and shamans dance; the people prostrate themselves and the spirits go back along the rope to their abodes. While the shaman throws three handfuls of wheat and jujubes into the air, the people try to catch them, as they fall, in their skirts; they mix them with the seeds for next year. A hard pull on the rope fixed on the pole breaks the bag containing jujubes made with dough, coins, and peas. Everybody tries to grab a couple of them, for having been touched by the coming and going of the spirits they enjoy their celebrated magical power. Sick persons eat them in order to be healed, and women so as to become pregnant. The fork with the two rolls is unbalanced; the rolls fall and are picked up; they are reduced to crumbs and are panaceas against all kind of ailments."
526,"(4) the nurturing of the spirits of the temple; shamanic dances infront of fortessess of incense, followed by a sacrifice of a chicken and the offering of its blood to the spirits in the temple"
527,"Wei-sang (fdzan garga): Wei is a Chinese word meaning “kindle”; sang is the Tibetan word Bsans meaning “cypress incense.” It is the rite performed before sunrise, daily during the first and fourth moon, or only on the first, eighth, or fifteenth of the month, by the heads of Monguor families for “Heaven and all the spirits”; it is also enacted simultaneously with most of the important rites. Some straw is spread in a small oven, a few pinches of pounded cones and leaves of cypress are strewn upon it, and a few pinches of flour, of roasted wheat or spelt, and a few drops of pure water are sprinkled; then all is lit and the odoriferous cypress smoke billows up. It is an “odoriferous offering,” not a purifying rite. To these three essential components some devout people like to add a pinch of the six usual pounded spices, dried flowers, red or white sugar, threads of five colors, a little butter or fat; some use wine instead of water, and blow the horn and prostrate themselves three times. Prayers are not said at that time. In performing the “big wei-sang” entire branches of cypress are burned. Lamas are fond of the rite, and even during shamanist rites it is observed. The oven wherein the rite is performed is constructed before the manikan or on the roof of the living room; sometimes it is performed on the edge of the manger. In time of epidemics, etc., the whole family never fails to enact the rite as a group."
528,"Thanksgiving, held in autumn after the harvest. The ceremony starts in the early morning at sunrise, with the erection of the pole. On top of the pole a white cloth flag is attached on which are printed Tibetan prayers or cabalistic designs. To the middle of the pole paper streamers are attached. While the pole is being put down into the hole of the big stone, designated for that purpose, the shamans beat the drums, build a fire in the yard, throw some cypress leaves into it, and sprinkle water on it. On windy days stones are heaped around the base of the pole to steady it. The villagers do not participate at the erection of the pole. After the shamans' breakfast, taken with some of the elders, the bell of the temple is rung and the drums are beaten to call the people for the ceremony. The long offering table is removed from the temple and placed in front of the pole. A big fire is built in front of the pole and the table, in the center of the temple yard; cypress boughs are thrown into the flames and water sprinkled on the fire. Shamans and helpers purify their hands and utensils in the smoke of the cypress boughs. In the early morning the hog is killed by cutting its throat. The blood is collected, the skin shaved, bowels cleansed, and blood mixed with flour and spices is stuffed into them, and they are exposed on the offering table. The victim is washed and smoked above the fire only. A number of food offerings are placed next to the sacrifice. In the meantime, the villagers arrive at the temple: men, women and children, with their own offerings of rolls, meat, raisins, cookies, which they deposit on the table. The shamans, wearing the flowery coat and the crown of the god of the Five Roads, start the rite by a beating of the drums. The audience kneels in a half circle around the fire, in front of the pole and the table. The chief and the elders of the village, in the first row, hold incense sticks in their joined hands. The chief of the village pours first a libation of milk and wine on the ground before the fire and throws several handfuls of pounded cypress cones and leaves on the fire and sprinkles water. When the smoke billows in the air, he kneels, and prostrating himself says, “Old Father Heaven you know that we thank you for the harvest,” and the whole audience prostrates itself three times in deep silence. Then the shamans beat drums in a slow tempo and the thanksgiving ceremony is finished. A large part of the hog is instantly prepared for a collective dinner, the remainder being divided in as many parts as there are families in the village. Each family has to partake of the sacrifice and receive a piece of meat and one roll. Planks are placed in rows in the temple yard and straw is spread on both sides of them. The audience sits down on the straw and starts dining and drinking. When the sun is about set and the dinner finished, the shamans beat the drums, the audience kneels, the chief of the village pours a last libation on the ground, throws some cypress leaves into the fire and sprinkles water. The pole is taken down while the audience prostrates three times. Paper banners and streamers and inscriptions, are burned in the fire. For that reason some Monguors call the rite “paper burning rite.” The villagers go home and the next morning the shamans"
529,"The entire village may be haunted by spirits, and so every year in wintertime the evil spirits hidden in the village have to be expelled. Usually the shaman is invited to drive them out. The shaman molds a small manikin with red earth and straw. It is carried from house to house by four young boys. Five boys, six years of age, run in front, each having half of his face blackened with soot and half whitened with flour. Carrying a bow, hammer, spear, and knife, they enter every courtyard, shouting at the top of their voices, leaping and gesticulating. Each member of the family rubs his face with a piece of a roll and red dyed cotton, and then puts these two items in a basket before the manikin. The whole group, with the shaman, then goes to the place reputed to be the abode of evil spirits. They light a big fire and burn the manikin and all the items. The shaman performs the dance which makes the evil spirits harmless, curses them and threatens to torture them if they dare to come again. This rite is also performed every time epidemics, such as measles, harm the village."
530,"Name-giving: On the morning of the same day the spear-soothsayer is invited. After he has drunk his morning tea, the master of the household gives the great incense offering in the yard, and the soothsayer divines whether he himself or the master of the family should give the child its name, and which name the spirit desires. If the soothsayer gives the name, then bread, tea, and butter are brought on a tray. The mother takes the child in her arms and places herself in front of the soothsayer. The latter sets the spear aside, takes some butter from the tray with his finger, smears it on the child's forehead, and says, for example: “He shall be called mountain-spirit.” This signifies that the child is consecrated to the mountain-spirit and will be called by its name after that he takes bread and offers it to the child to eat; he likewise offers it tea. It is not the child, however, but the mother who eats the gifts. Then everyone makes a threefold kowtow in the house to the soothsayer and the Buddha image, and outside to the sky. Following the name-giving or in the course of the day, the mother with the child in her arms must kowtow to all the guests; for this she receives a small gift of money for the child. — Towards noon the family holds a general feast, for men and women separately. On this occasion much barley wine is drunk, and there is singing and dancing."
531,"New Year's morning: At the first cockcrow after midnight even the last stragglers put on their best clothes. Only the very old in the family remain lying on the kang. The master of the household puts large, burning butter- or oil-lamps in the room on the household altar. In the yard he hangs a red paper lantern with a butter-lamp to the mani -tree It is attached to a transverse strip on it. Then outside, with the entire family, he gives the great incense offering, and everyone makes a threefold kowtow to the sky out in the open. The same is repeated before the household altar for the countless other spirits. During this time a stone is made red-hot in the hearth fire, and with this glowing stone all the rooms of the compound are fumigated. At the same time the conch is blown. The fumigation may also be done by women. Then a second offering follows. The master of the household takes little sticks of incense, one for each member of the family, and lights them in the room above the lamp. Then he goes out around the mani -pole and, with all the members of the family, makes a threefold kowtow to the sky, facing the main house. He puts the little sticks in the incense oven on the round manger. Then the same ceremony is repeated in the house before the household altar, where the new little sticks continue to smolder in the incense basin. During the entire ceremony rockets and cannons are fired in order to scare away the demons. Together with the incense, yellow paper is also burned, exactly as among the Chinese. Once the incense ceremony is over, the master of the household places a table in the yard before the round manger. On it are put trays with five steamed loaves, five oil-loaves, three taġur loaves, and all kinds of baked goods. Then a bowl of barley wine is poured out and a threefold kowtow is again made to the sky. The same ceremony is repeated before the household altar for the other gods."
532,"The fire-pouring. Occurs after family misfortune and during some cremation ceremonies. On the morning of the seventh day, immediately after sunrise, the lama says his morning prayer, drinks tea, and makes the fire-torma. Meanwhile, after the incense offering, everything is prepared outside for the fire ceremony. Next to the burning-place a large iron kettle for melting the butter is put on three stones. A pile of firewood lies next to it. A felt mat for the lama is put to the west of the wall pouring he places over his knees for protection, so that no liquid butter will drip on his clothes. Next to the seat one places the fire fan consisting of a piece of white cloth that is provided with two little parallel sticks, so that the lama can grasp it with both hands. The fire is fanned with it because one may not pollute it with his breath. In front of the lama-seat and the wall there is a small table for the cult implements, prayer book, bell, etc. To the right of the seat there stands a small table on which to put the pouring-tube and the spoon. To the left, next to the lama-seat, one puts a wide board or a door taken off its hinges, over which one spreads a sack, and over that a white cloth runner. The tray with the pieces of wood and the 12 little plates with the burning-spices are on top of that. Furthermore the following are kept in readiness: several flintstones or a box of matches, a butter-lamp, a paper lantern, and a lighting pole such as is also used at the cremation. Now the lama comes out with the fire-torma and puts it in the center of the ground-drawing on a layer of cypress twigs. Around this the men pile up the prescribed firewood in the shape of an octogon that tapers toward the top, leaving an empty space in the center around the torma. They then fill this space with cypress twigs. The gift-master then ceremoniously hands a hada to the lama and requests him to begin the ceremony. While he goes to the other side of the pile of wood and makes a threefold kowtow, there to the lama, the lama sprinkles the pile of wood with holy water and scatters barley kernels on it, over which he has breathed three times. Now the gift-master strikes a spark from the flint at the first blow, catches it with hemp tow, blows it to a small flame in a little bundle of straw, and lights the butter-lamp with it. Then the paper lantern lamp is lighted with the light of the butter-lamp. The ceremony and the rules are exactly the same as at the cremation. Now one hands the lama the lighting pole. He holds its head of tow over the butter-lamp until it flames up and sets fire to the pile of wood with it. As soon as the fire flames high, all those present fall on their knees and make a threefold kowtow. In case the fire does not burn immediately, the lama fans it with the cloth fan. Now the fire-pouring follows. The lama places the cloth over his knees, takes the pouring tube, lays it with the outflow over the wall, holds the handle with his left hand, and with his right hand pours spoonfuls of liquid butter into the funnel, so that it flows in a stream into the fire and flames up violently. After he has done this a few times, one hands him the little plates with the burnt offerings. With the first three fingers of his right hand, he takes one of the two portions each time and with benedictions throws it into the fire. Then some pieces of wood follow, then again pourings of butter, little plates, etc., until everything is burned in the fire. The lama now gives the concluding prayer amidst the sound of his percussion instruments and returns to the house. — He cleans his instruments, takes his meal, receives his fee, and on the following day rides back to the monastery with his companions, unless one wants to keep him there for other prayers that have nothing to do with the fire-pouring."
533,"The sowing festival and the festival of the harvest thanksgiving are completely identical. Only in the autumn people have more flour and meat to celebrate the festival. Both festivals last several days. A definite number of days is not prescribed. At the festival one differentiates between the offering and the dances of the shamans. The offering is undertaken by the seed-master or the village elder. The dances last for an entire day; usually a market is also connected with them. The shamans erect a pole in the temple yard, pray several days, send out sicknesses on the first evening, and from a distance kill children or cause them to become unconscious. In the evening of the final day, before they take down the pole, they take the sicknesses back; then the people struck by them become healthy again. The shamans are always men. They wear women's clothes and a woman's hairdo. Their drum consists of an iron or wooden ring over which is stretched a sheepskin. They carry the litter of the mother-goddess onto a threshing floor and dance before it. During the dance the drums are beaten. They do all kinds of acrobatic feats, and one of them goes into a great trance and wounds himself."
534,"When the children die, the cattle are stricken, the harvest is battered, or other great misfortunes befall a family, a god is angry. One must appease him. Sometimes the god desires an animal. One learns from the soothsayer which god and which animal are involved. Then the soothsayer sets the spear aside. Hastily the people run to fetch a sheep. They bring it into the yard, because one consecrates an animal to the sky only out in the open. A man holds in his hand a little plate with barley; on top of this he places a narrow red band. He stands next to the soothsayer, who again has invoked the god and amidst spear shaking supervises the action. Now once more there is an interrogation, during which one determines when the consecration is to be renewed. The sheep is then washed from head to foot with pure water. The soothsayer takes some grains of barley from the little plate with the tip of the spear and throws them into the incense, which is burned throughout the ceremony. Another puts some of the incense in a hollow tile and fumigates the sheep all around. Then he pours a bowl of milk over the animal's neck, back, and head. All the men kneel around the sheep in a circle, and when it shakes itself they make a three-fold kowtow, for the sky has accepted the animal. The soothsayer sets the spear aside. Now one takes the red band from the little plate, holds it in the incense, ties it in the wool on the sheep's shoulder, and lets the sheep run free. It may run where it will, for it belongs to the sky. Each year this sacred sheep is again brought here in the first month from the first to the fifteenth day. Then the consecration is renewed in similar fashion before the spirit-spear and a new band is tied in the wool."
535,"The washing of the sick: The washing takes place in the kitchen. The following things are needed for it: seven bowls of fresh water, an iron knife, a door lock, seven white stones, a bowl of liquor, some flowers, three, five, and seven pieces of paper with certain prayer texts, seven different things in all. Now in the kitchen the hearth kettle is washed, fumigated, and placed on the fire. The master of the household lights the fire and throws incense twigs into it. Now the shaman, already in a trance, comes out of the main house into the kitchen; in his right hand he holds his spirit-sword, while he keeps his left hand free for the various actions. First the seven bowls of water are poured into the kettle, and the shaman throws incense twigs and Tibetan barley into it. Then he thrusts his sword through his clothes into his chest as proof of his power and in order to purify himself. No blood flows. Meanwhile the sick person is brought into the kitchen. The shaman bares the chest of the patient and thrusts the above-mentioned knife midway into it. No blood may flow. If the sick person bleeds, then he will not be healed; if he does not bleed, he will be saved. The shaman plasters the wound with one of the prayer sheets; he throws the knife into the kettle. During this time a man heats the seven white stones in the hearth fire until they are red-hot. Then he takes them out with an iron spoon and with it hands them to the shaman. The latter takes one stone after another in his mouth and spits them into the kettle. Then he throws the other things, the lock, the flowers, and the prayer texts, into the water and finally pours in the bowl of liquor. Now the sick person is completely disrobed, and the shaman washes him from top to bottom with his one free hand, scooping the boiling water out of the kettle with his hand. Then the sick person is put back on his kang in the house. The fire-blowing: After the washing the shaman goes into the room of the sick person. During this time the men in the yard start a strong fire with sheep dung and wood. They put a plowshare in it and make it white-hot. A man puts a stick through the white-hot plowshare and takes it in to the shaman, who is still in a trance, but has given his sword to another man. Now he seizes the glowing plowshare with both hands with a hada that hangs from his breast-mirror, licks it with his bare tongue, takes a respectable mouthful of liquor, and turns to the sick person. He blows the alcohol out of his mouth over the plowshare in strong blasts, which each time makes a burst of fire shoot out toward the sick person. Then he takes the plowshare in front of the gate and places it at the foot of the yard wall. There the men immediately throw earth over it and wall it in. The drink of the sick: Now the shaman again goes into the room of the sick person. A man extends an iron spoon to him. He rips off a piece of the hada on his protective-mirror, places it in the spoon, and throws a few barley kernels in it. Then a man pours water into the spoon until it is full, holds it in the hearth fire until the water boils and the cloth and barley are thoroughly boiled. He hands this decoction to the sick person who must drink it down immediately. With that the ceremony is ended"
536,"If someone is seriously ill, then the shaman, with the men of the household, undertakes a house-purification. On this occasion the demon is conjured out of the house in a straw doll, dragged out of the village, and burned. Exorcism: Towards evening, when darkness begins to fall, the shaman goes into a trance before the household altar. During this time a man runs out of the village with the hen to a crossroads, twists or hacks off the hen's head, and with the fluttering hen squirts the blood in all directions of the compass. Then he throws away the hen as food for the demon and goes home. — The straw man is put on the threshold of the main house or in the yard. As soon as the shaman is in a trance, he jumps up and, running in wild leaps through all the rooms of the compound, performs the sword battle against the demon. The men follow him. Stones hail down on the ground. One circles around in the rooms with the torches. One man holds the oil-pan, takes mouthfuls of liquor, and blows it over the fire into the room, so that each time a red flash shoots out. Others crack the whip from room to room and shoot burning arrows at the floor. In this way the demon is driven into the straw doll. This is dragged by a hemp string or a straw rope out of the gate over the village street to the nearest crossroads, where the hen is lying. The shaman follows, fighting with his sword; stones, blows, fire-arrows, and flashes of fire rain down on the doll. It is left lying at the crossroads. The men pour the oil out of the pan over it, throw the torches, arrows, stones, etc. on it, and leave it smoldering."
537,"At the marriage ceremony, an old man gives a blessing to the couple and orders prostrations. Cash is thrown at the feet of the couple. The bride has not spoken all day or relieved herself (she does not drink on the previous day). Her mouth must be ‘opened’ by the mother in law. Starting from today you are forbidden to divulge anything that goes on in the family, and anything that will happen in the future. You will not repeat within the family what you will hear outside. A daughter-in-law's mouth must be ‘hard’ (do not tell anything) with respect to people outside, it must be ‘flexible’ toward her relatives.”Dinner is eaten and gin is drunk. The master of ceremonies of the son-in-law's family then takes the floor to distribute the traditional gifts to the daughter-in-law's family. then comes what is called the suhuta, the final ceremony where a number of animals are given/ taken by the daughter-in-aw’s family. The number of animals is negociated and sometimes involves an argument or fight."
538,"Whether the clinic is sited near a river or not, on about the seventh day, depending on the number of days divined, the client, who has been wearing the white dress made out of the purchased white or red material, removes this and wraps round the waist only a small piece of the cloth, cut from the remnants. The “ogbanje” client now takes with him in a container, all the ingredients purchased for the treatment. At the river, he unwraps and casts this piece of cloth as well as the dress which had been worn during the week, into the river. The contents of the container carried to the river are also emptied into the river. Following this, the client bathes in the river, walks back to the bank and dries himself. The diviner cuts a piece from the “okpete” and places it on the client's path and asks the client to walk over it. Thereafter, the client is asked to pick up the “okpete” and without looking back, to walk back to the river and then throw the “okpete” over his head into the river. He then announces to the “ogbanje” group that his link with the group is broken by this symbolic gesture. He implores them to leave him severely alone. In addition to this, the diviner counsels the client on what further to avoid, or do, in order to reinforce the treatment given."
539,"The procedure for initiation includes the following: “isa ugegbe ndi otu” (washing the mirror of the group); “isa iru ndi otu” (washing the face of the group); “iw□ ar□ ndi otu” (washing the body of the group); and “ikwo aka ndi otu” (washing the hands of the group). The individual buys “edo”, white chalk, soap, perfume, a special herb and root and a mirror. This initiation takes place in a special part of the river sacred for ritual performances. Potent herbs and roots including ‘ose nabo’ and ‘obala nabo’, ‘abubu nile’ etc. are mixed into a paste with water from this special part of the river. A little of the smarting solution is squeezed into the devotee's eyes, and the rest mixed into a solution for washing the body. The devotee then washes the face, hands and body with this solution. The diviner invokes the spirits, presents the offerings brought by the devotee and pleads with them to grant the needs of the devotee i.e. to be invested with the powers to help divine and treat “ogbanje mmiri” spirits since “Nne Mmiri” has so prescribed. A little of the solution with which the patient washes himself is squeezed into his eyes. He rubs some of it on the temple and the rest on the face of the mirror. The mirror now becomes a symbol of the initiate's identity with “Nne Mmiri” and her water spirits. Whenever he needs their help, he peers into the mirror and communicates his needs to the spirit beings who immediately respond. There are special rules to be observed and taboo to be avoided once initiated."
540,"An “ogbanje mmiri” who has a husband or wife in the river is difficult to treat. This is because the river husband or wife as the case may be, is usually unrelenting in his/her hold on the “ogbanje” client. These water spouses are also said to be very jealous indeed. But at the same time, they take very good and tender care of their “ogbanje” earth spouses, visiting them very frequently. These spirit husbands/wives mate with their earth spouses in their sleep with the result that these earth spouses find it difficult to enter a fulfilling sexual relationship with their human mates. For treatment, the following items are purchased: a doll, perfume, soap with fresh and delicate fragrance, sponge, white cloth (as prescribed by divination), powder (face and body), body cream with delicate fragrance, earring, necklace, bracelets, rings, comb, mirror. The assortment of items purchased is relative to the fashion of the times which partly indicates why prescription for treatment is not standard. What seems to be a constant is the doll which symbolizes the spouse. If the “ogbanje” client is a man, he may be required to include ankle chain, cuff links etc. depending on his status in life. After procuring these items, the “ogbanje” proceeds as follows: He snips off some crop of hair from his body (head, axila, pubic area, body etc.). The hairs are kept separate. The “ogbanje” client moistens each crop of hair with perfume and body cream. Then he touches the hair from his head on the doll's head, that from the axila on the doll's axila, and so forth until contact has been made between the “ogbanje's” body hair and the corresponding part of the doll's body. Then the “ogbanje” client or his relation clads this doll with a dress made exclusively from the white cloth. For seven days, the “ogbanje” uses only the purchased items for toiletting etc. Nothing other than the prescribed items are touched. During that week, the “ogbanje” client either wears a dress made from the remaining white material or merely ties a strip of this cloth round his waist as a symbol of the dress to be worn. The “ogbanje” client sleeps with the doll for seven days. He touches, cuddles, strokes, the doll in ways characteristic of his relationship with a real close mate. On the eighth day, he carries all the items enumerated above, as well as the doll, down to the river where, after a thorough bath, the items are emptied into the river with the “ogbanje” kneeling. As the “ogbanje” kneels in the posture of one bathing in a river, all the items worn and used over the past seven days snugly heaped over his clasped laps, he now gently parts the legs so that the heaped items empty themselves into the river. The ogbanje then retreats to the bank and dries himself. He cuts an “okpete”, walks over it and without looking back tells the spirit spouse that the link between them is by this ritual and gesture, broken for ever."
541,"Feast to the ilaw-maw. At the time appointed the alusi (idols) are brought out of the house, and placed in order of rank. In the central and most prominent position is the Ikenga, and he is flanked on the one side by the piece of ebwo wood representing the deceased father of the man, and on the other by the stick representing Chi (his own guardian spirit). Around these three the minor alusi are grouped; all being in due order water is poured over the alusi that they may “wash their hands” before eating. Kola nut is then formally presented, followed by pounded yam dipped in soup, a portion being placed upon the head of each alusi. For such ceremonies each wife supplies her share of the food required. The food having been duly offered, and the essence thereof consumed by the spirits, a child comes forward and takes the food from the head of one of the alusi and eats it. Any other children present follow the example of the first; they may eat it immediately or take it away and re-divide it amongst themselves at their leisure. The hunger of the spirits having thus been appeased, they are refreshed with palm wine or gin. A small quantity is poured over the alusi, and the company present drink the remainder. Finally, water is again poured over them to enable the spirits to “wash their hands” after eating."
542,"Boys pass through the initiatory rites of the Ayakka society on attaining what is considered an understanding age, i.e. about ten years. The ceremony is known as “Iba na maw” or the “entering into the domain of spirit.” The preliminary stages are carried through by, and at the instigation of, the elder men of the family. Should the father be alive, he begins by offering palm wine to the Umunna, i.e. the male relatives (of the lad) who are already full members of the society, and on the night fixed for his son to enter ju-ju he brings presents of soup and yams. It is usually so arranged that several lads may be initiated at the same time; this saves trouble and expense. The novices sit in the appointed place and are left to themselves; here they remain until all preparations are completed for the ceremony. They are then led into the courtyard of the house where the ju-ju is waiting for them to appear. They are ordered to lie prone on their stomachs with their eyes to the ground; the maw or ju-ju proceeds to step over each candidate in turn, after which they are bidden to roll over and over (instead of walking) and finally retire once more into their room. Here a piece of bone—preferably the tooth of a goat—is handed to each lad and he is bidden to chew it, the instructors stating that these are the teeth of the ju-ju. This is known as the ceremony of Awlupulu Maw (lit. “eating dirt off the teeth of the spirit!” By this time the youths have been worked up into a more or less frightened condition, and are huddled together in a corner. As the night advances—the performance having begun about nine o'clock—the maw enters the room and makes a great pretence of removing certain parts of the bodies of the lads, because these are demanded by the ju-ju, as his special prerogative, for food. Meantime the members of the society who are present are urging the candidates to produce their gifts, promising to intercede with the spirits if it be made worth their while. It is the only way for a lad to secure merciful treatment, and moreover the threat is held out that unless the present is forthcoming the friends will not work for the boy's release from the power of the maw, which means that, having been drawn down into the spirit-world, the niggardly candidate will have to stay there. The candidates are told that they will be made to pass through the hole of an abwissi (a tiny insect) and thence be obliged to cross a very wide river on a thread. For this perilous journey one needs friendly assistance, and this may be assured by means of an acceptable present to the masters of the ceremonies. Neglect the gift and you must walk the miniature tight-rope unaided. Food is now brought forth and the lads are asked to partake thereof, but they are much too frightened to eat. The members, however, make short work of it and soon clear the dishes. Absolute silence succeeds the meal and in due course everybody drops off to sleep. On waking from their slumbers the candidates are informed that their presents were very acceptable and that, in consequence, their friends had begged so fervently for them that they had prevailed upon the maw to conduct them to and from the spirit-world whilst they were asleep and unconscious of fear. They had had a merciful escape and were very fortunate to have made the adventurous journey with so little inconvenience."
543,"Purification must always be performed after menstruation. This is little more than ceremonial washing. The woman must first wash herself outside the compound walls after dark, using a water-pot reserved solely for the purpose. It is a round pot with a wide mouth called “oku aru”, meaning the one vessel used for cleansing after menstruation. Next day, she may proceed to the stream, but is forbidden to enter the water straightway. She stands on the bank apart from other people present. Another woman brings a pot of water to her and she washes her body thoroughly. This completed, she may enter the water as a cleansed woman; and (if married) resume cooking for her husband and others in the compound."
544,"The acts of presenting, breaking, distributing, and consuming the kola nut in the context of “begging the dead.” The father takes one of the kola nuts presented to him by the person serving homage, hands it to his wife to be washed, then holds it in his right hand, and, blowing on it to indicate that both the kola and the words he will utter are clean, he begins his prayer. After this prayer, the sentences of which are punctuated with utterances of “ìsé ” (“so be it”) by all persons present, the father breaks open the kola nut, picks off the germinal sprout—called “head of kola” (isi-ɔjι), the senior portion—and drops it on the floor as an offering to the dead. Breaking the cotyledons up into as many pieces as necessary, he takes the best as his priestly prerogative, calls the person who has performed service to receive a piece of kola directly from his hand, and transfers the remainder in a tray to the most junior person present, who then serves the others in descending order of seniority. All must eat of the kola to affirm the meaning of the prayer."
545,
546,"If the sacrifice is to be a “festival,” the lineage priest brings out the okposi sticks representing the dead and places his ɔfɔ staff upon them; beside these objects he sets the vessel representing his personal god, his personal ikenga statue, and perhaps various treasure boxes and staves. These objects are all placed together upon the “face of the throne” (´ιru-ùkpo ). When the congregation has gathered, the priest occupies his throne. He is presented with a bowl of water, washes his hands in order to cool them, washes the kola nuts set before him, and then sprinkles water on the dead to quench the heat in them. The opening prayer and distribution of kola are validated by the priest's spitting chewed kola upon the accumulated shrine objects and his touching these shrines and the ground with his ɔfɔ stick. The person who has requested the feast then steps forward and, addressing all assembled persons in appropriate order, recounts the conditions under which he has asked for the activity, presents the goods he has brought to the lineage priest, and requests the priest to utilize them in worship for the benefit of everyone present. Several steps of begging the dead follow. The priest first receives a cup of palm wine presented him by the supplicant, and pours a small portion of it upon the objects representing the dead while he prays to them. The remainder he hands back to the supplicant, who kneels to take it, calling the honorific name of the priest then drinking down the cup of ritually blessed liquid. The priest then calls all others under him whom he wishes to honor—his wives, his children, his junior brothers, etc.—and they too kneel in sign of their homage (nru) and call him by his honorific name. When the priest is satisfied, the other lineage priests present may follow the same pattern, taking cups of wine which they bless through libation and calling upon their subordinates to receive and drink then in recognition of their priestly right to beg the dead. Gin may then be served in the same ritual pattern. The major phase of begging the dead begins, however, when an animal is sacrificed and its blood runs freely upon the shrines. At this time, the priest first takes hair or feathers from the neck of the animal and places it upon the various shrines; then, begging the ancestors to receive and be contented with this blood, and to leave their descendants to live in peace, he cuts the animal's throat and directs a spray of blood over the shrine objects. The sticks representing his personal god must not be touched by the flowing blood, which is food suitable only for the dead. The remainder of the blood is collected in a pan, cooked, and served out to the participants under the priest's direction. In each such ceremonial act, the father or lineage priest performing the ritual receives a special portion of the animal killed (e.g. an “arm” of a goat, while the supplicant receives the skin and head. At the end of such ceremonies, speeches are made by the senior lineage priest, the supplicant, and others, summarizing and assessing the significance of what has been done. Then “money for the dead” (égo ´mm□ɔ ) is brought forth by the supplicant and presented to the presiding priest. The priest takes an initial portion as representative senior son of the dead, and then every person present, including the priest, receives a personal portion as a gift “for one's own god” (ego chi). The ceremony closes with the priest's prayerful avowal that the action has been properly intended and performed, as he beats his ɔfɔ emblem on the ground to send that message of validation to the land of the group and to the ancestral dead."
547,"Ritual adultery confession. The Daughters of the husband's lineage who hear a man's wife's adultery confession (iwa okuku: to swear on a chicken). A woman who has been so accused first takes kola nuts and a bottle of gin to the lineage priest of her husband's family to have him offer to his ritual objects. Then after the Daughters have assembled at the priest's house, the Head Daughter breaks a kola nut and prays for the spirits of her village to assist them in seeing that the wife conceals nothing. She justifies her acts by saying that she is merely doing as her forefathers and mothers have done. All eat the kola, the accused wife, clad only in a white loin cloth taking it first. Next, the Head Daughter takes a cock and holding the jaw and upper beak, tears the jaw down to the neck. She then gives the cock to the wife who kneels and confesses the names of all her lovers since her betrothal or marriage. It is believed that as soon as she finishes naming her partners, the cock will die. If it does not, the Daughters may permit her to take sand and say “Those I remember and those I forget are as plentiful as the sand”. The cock should then die. Some of the Daughters of the wife's patrilineage will also be present at the confession, but only as witnesses to carry the message to their own family. The husband's lineage will have advised him to refrain from eating his wife's cooking lest it make him ill."
548,"The ritual of washing and shaving the corpse (iwu ozu aru: “to wash body of corpse”). For this, they use a clay pot and a calabash provided by the widow. In the past, the body would be rubbed with camwood (ufie ) as a preservative measure and its orifices stuffed with tobacco to prevent bloating. To avoid contamination through contact with the corpse, the Daughters hold egbo leaves in their teeth and place more of these leaves in the water which is used to wash the corpse. These leaves are believed to prevent the Daughters and also the Youths, who dress a deceased man, from “losing their memories and becoming like the corpse” (Okala 1953:643). All the deceased's attendants wear old clothing which can be discarded to rid themselves of impurities connected with their association with the corpse."
549,"If there has been a serious dispute between the husband and wife, especially one which has resulted in a wife leaving her husband's house, and if no formal reconciliation or bride wealth refund has been made prior to the husband's death, the Daughters, by refusing to eat any food prepared by the widow for her husband's funeral, will prevent her from properly mourning her husband in his house. To rectify the situation, the wife must undergo a reconciliation ceremony with her late husband, conducted by the Daughters, for which she must provide a fowl, kola and palm wine. After touching the chicken to the body of the deceased and then circling first the corpse and then the widow with a glass of palm wine, the Head Daughter announces that any disagreement between the husband and wife has now been settled. The wine is poured outside the house and the chicken, which has taken up the anger of the corpse, is cut in two, one part being placed on the right hand side of the deceased's family square, as a sacrifice to the living, the other on the left hand side, to the dead."
550,"In the late afternoon, the titled men perform the ceremony of ewu akpa (lit: goat bag) with which they formally sever all ties with the deceased. For this ritual, the titled men bring their ossissi staves to the room where the deceased lies in state. When a Village Youth cuts the throat of a male goat, blood is directed onto these crossed staves. Unlike the ceremony of ewu izuzu performed when the deceased was still officially alive, in this rite his titled staff is not included. After the goat meat has been divided into two equal parts, some of it is put into a leather sack along with money to represent the last share of meat the deceased will receive from his colleagues as a titled man. He is notified in a prayer that after this time, he no longer will share anything with the ozo men in affairs regarding title. Then his undecorated ozo staff is cut in two by a Youth and put into the grave, unlike his iron-banded staff which should be kept by his descendants. The other part of the meat is taken by the Village Youths, since titled men may not eat an animal killed by a Youth. Youths are chosen for the ritual act of goat-killing because they are believed to be innocent of any stain of abomination."
551,"The placing of the corpse into its coffin occurs during the ceremony of “ghost buries corpse” (mmuo ini ozu ). The Tall Ghost, wearing a high peaked robe that covers all parts of the body, represents a reincarnated deceased titled man and acts on behalf of the masquerade society of the deceased's village, the one in which he was initiated as a young man. Actions by the Tall Ghost carry the most fearful sanction of the village and, at burial, serve to sacralize and validate the rite. The very presence of this masquerade relates the deceased to his new role in the spirit world. While the Tall Ghost leans over the corpse, squeaking and singing, an assistant takes a small chick and splits its back, letting its blood fall on the deceased's eyes. This chick is a gift from the Tall Ghost to a brave man who has been initiated into the masquerade society. The chirps of this chick, as it hangs above the grave until it dies, emphasize the sadness of the occasion. A cock, which is also killed by one of the masquerade's assistants at this time, is believed to signify by its characteristic crowing that the day has come for burial and the deceased should make himself ready. After these sacrifices, the Tall Ghost informs the corpse that the cock will lead it to the spirit world and adds in farewell. “It is as if a brother does not know his brother” (Ife dika nwanne onye amazia ), i.e., there are no brothers as far as death is concerned. Here again, as in the ceremony of ewu akpa there is a formalized breaking of all ties between the living and the dead, in this case, even between lineage members. Also present at this rite may be the Tall Ghost of the deceased's mother's village, if it has been invited by the Chief Mourner or the deceased's children to salute “its child” before he is buried."
552,"Each of these one-day festivals follows a similar procedure. Every householder conducting the feast brings out his shrine objects on the morning of the festival day. When all household members have gone outdoors, the head daughter moves through the village repeatedly performing the ceremony of “calming the house” (ιj□-□nɔ). Standing by the threshold of each house where the ceremony is to be performed, she exacts tribute in yams from each wife of the household and in return provides each with salt, fish, and oil for the day's ceremonial cooking. This is a symbolic statement of the ideal trade relations between lineage daughters and wives. Then, holding a live fowl in her left hand, she enters the house and drags the fowl's body over the floor and walls in order to draw into it the heat of evils that have accumulated there. Holding a white snail shell (éjùna-ńzu ) on the end of a stick, she touches it to the same surfaces, to cool the house. As she performs these acts she chants repeatedly: Let all forbidden things clear out of the house; let money come; children will come; strong health will come; let evil clear out, and sickness depart from the house. After this is done in each house throughout the patrilineage community, in descending order of patrilineage seniority, each household priest begins his ceremony, calling upon his dependents to receive food and drink from him, and sacrificing a cock (and if possible, a mammal). He then sends annual homage service (ife nru aro) to his immediately senior patrilineage priest, in the form of ten yams and the wing of the cock sacrificed. A daughter's child to the clan performing the festival may also celebrate the occasion by killing a fowl on his shrines to “the mothers” and sending a wing of the fowl to his mother's senior patrilineage priest."
553,"After the new yam festival of the head priests of ekwensu, the “killers' feasts” (`ɔgbalido ) are performed by the chiefs and warriors of the community. Each killer goes to the kapok tree planted in honor of his warrior feat, carrying the lower jaw of his victim in his left hand and the “killing knife” (´mmà-ògbu ) in his right (thus emulating the ikenga figure). Singing praises to the potency of his ikenga spirit, he dances before the tree and then sacrifices a dog, the animal associated with malevolent ghosts. He also sacrifices a cock to his ikenga in gratitude for his good fortune. On the day all the chiefs perform this sacrifice, the senior chiefs bring forth their war drums and call the chiefs officially under them in war to come and dance. The senior chiefs kill rams to their ikenga, honoring their powers. While these killers' feasts are performed, the king remains in retreat. However, as the greatest of all killers, he sends his slaves to visit all the chiefs' houses, where they collect one foreleg of each dog sacrificed. Thus he participates vicariously in the ritual, and gains some of the strength of the warriors."
554,"The king's annual emergence (ɔfala) from seclusion (which he enters during the new yam festival). He demonstrates that he has survived another year as a living atonement for the sins and misdeeds of the Onitsha people, that he has mourned the community's dead and been shown guiltless of their deaths, that he and the community have been filled with strength, fullness and richness of life, and that he has foreseen the events of the year and found them to be good. Festive cloths are tied around the throne in the house of breezes, where the king has fasted. Messages are sent to all of the towns around Onitsha that recognize the greatness of the Onitsha king, calling them to send dancers and chiefs further to glorify the festival. The royal war drums are set up beside the throne, and traditionally a slave was tied near the trees at the entryway to the palace square where a medicine bundle protects the palace from dangerous forces. At this great festival everyone wears his finest clothing. The senior chiefs arrive, announced by cannon shots and accompanied by the junior chiefs and ɔzɔ men of their villages. Each procession enters through the archway, passing, formerly, the slave tied there and calling out messages for him to deliver to the dead. The most junior of the senior chiefs approaches the house of breezes first and dances to the royal drums, pretending to threaten the crowd with gestures of his war sword. When he tires of dancing he stops the drums with a touch of his sword, and he and his chiefs take their seats beside the palace entry. All the senior chiefs dance in this way, culminating with the prime minister, who then leads them into the main palace chamber where they privately salute the king. Surrounded by his entourage of chiefs and flanked by slaves bearing his sacrificial and war swords, the king emerges from the palace wearing his great headdress, living evidence of the well-being of the community. According to one early visitor to Onitsha, the king was expected at this time to carry a weight of earth on his back in order to demonstrate his ability to bear the burdens of power. Greeted by the cheers of his subjects, the king dances outwards to the entry arch; there, formerly, he touched his sacrificial sword (ada) to the bound slave, who was then killed by a slave executioner. The king then returns to the palace and retires while dancing groups perform. He emerges a second and a third time, going around the square to salute the trees that have ceremonial associations with his personal god. He then retires to the breeze house."
555,"On that day the heir is formally installed, and there is a feast. The feast is called ‘the emerging from death’. A goat or fowl from the dead man's estate may be slaughtered for it, and neighbours and friends also bring contributions of cooked millet and other food, as well as beer. Before the feast begins the heir is formally installed. The heir is dressed in a bark-cloth. Another old man, probably another of the dead man's close friends, then takes a spear, and raising it as though he were about to strike the heir with it in the face, he approaches him and gives a short speech regarding how the hier should act, towards the household and his father's old friends. After this the sponsor brings the boy into the house, where the dead man's stool has been placed on a bark-cloth in its accustomed place, facing and to the right of the doorway, in the place called rusika rwa nyineka (the household head's partition, or room). He is seated on the stool. Then his father's spear is handed to him. Coffee berries which have been cooked and dried, customarily handed round on polite formal occasions, are brought in, also ensigosigo (grains of finger millet and simsim). The sponsor picks up a pinch of this and sprinkles it on the ground, praying “may there be life, wealth and childbearing; men die, they leave others behind”. And the heir also sprinkles some of it before and behind him, and so do the other people present, some of them repeating the same prayer. But the heir does not speak; he has to remain completely silent throughout the ceremony. After this everybody is given coffee berries to chew, and a round basket is put in the middle of the floor for people to put small gifts in for the heir, usually ten- or fifty-cent pieces, sometimes shillings. At this time, also, anybody who has a claim against the estate of the dead man introduces himself and explains about the debt he is claiming. After all this is finished, the heir leaves the stool and retires to remove his bark-cloth. Then he begins to dispense food and beer to all the guests"
556,"The ceremony of ‘sweeping out the house for the baby’. Occurs after a 3-4 day seclusion of the mother after giving birth. During that period of seclusion she never took anything outside the house, not even the baby's faeces. It is also referred to as ‘the ceremony of leaving the fireside’ that is, ending the seclusion for the mother and baby. Everything movable in the house was taken outside and the house was given a thorough cleaning. The carpet of grass which till then had covered the floor was removed for replacement. The women pushed it and kicked it out with their feet amidst laughter and cheering (referred to as ‘the laughter of sweeping’). When all the cleansing was finished, a millet dish was prepared for everyone present. All ate, and, on that day the state of ritual danger came to an end. The mother was free to return to her normal life and sleep on her own bed."
557,"‘Making the child sit up’. Throughout the first three months for a girl and four months for a boy, the child was not allowed to sit unsupported but was rather carried in the nurse's arms or made to lie down. Then at the end of the three or four months, as the case might be, an evening was chosen for the ceremony and a feast was prepared to which many relatives had been invited. After the meal, a special kind of local barkcloth (enterwa mabale), that is, one made by being beaten with stones instead of a mallet, was spread out on the ground. The baby was helped to sit on it for a short time, and then lifted off; this was repeated three or four times, then finally the child was given a name."
558,"Blood brotherhood. The two friends were asked to sit on a large cow-skin or on a barkcloth spread on the ground in the living-room. A senior woman brought a basket containing the following objects to be used in the ceremony: coffee-berries, a razor, a certain kind of grass called obujubwa and twigs from the omutoma tree. One coffee-berry was picked out and divided into two, the beans having been separated from the husks. Then, with a locally made razor, each man in turn made a small incision on his stomach, just below the navel. He then rubbed the coffee bean in the blood, took it in his own right hand and offered it to his friend. The latter took the coffee bean with his lips from his friend's hand and swallowed it without biting or chewing it. This procedure was reciprocated. After this part of the ceremony, they took the small ejubwa stems and mutoma twigs and touched one another with them, first on the stomach, then on the head, the hands, and the feet. While doing this, they made the following pledges: ‘Children of the same father pull one another's kaboba kenda. They shave one another's heads, pare one another's nails, and pull out one another's thorns.’ After saying this, they put the plants back in the basket. They stood up in turn, and each recounted his own family and background saying: ‘I am so and so, of such and such a clan, my mother's clan is such and such …’ The friend who first requested the ceremony then offered his friend the gift of tying the friendship, or the ‘blood-pact’. It was usually money to the value of fifty shillings, which he placed in a basket provided for the occasion. The household head prepared a very big feast in which everyone present took part and enjoyed themselves."
559,"After a proper interval, the friend in whose house the ceremony had taken place would pay a return visit to the other's homestead. A very lavish feast was prepared for him too, and if the host's mother was still alive, the visitor was expected to carry out an institutionalized act of stealing something from her. This ritualized stealing was intended to install the friend as a real son, an ‘insider’, in his friend's mother's house, just like his friend who, when young, may have eaten her food without her permission. In fact, it was all pre-arranged like this. A small amount of millet food was prepared, or else a small pot of beer was placed in a fairly obvious position. The visitor went around, pretending to be searching for something, like a hungry child looking for forbidden fruit, until he eventually found it. This established his status in the home on the basis that he was no longer an ‘outsider’ and that any time he wished, he could call on his new ‘mother’. He would be prepared to be served with any food available at the moment, and no unnecessary fuss would be made over him"
560,"If any two friends, or acquaintances grew to hate one another violently, they would regard each other as open enemies. The tension and the relationship of mutual enmity between them was then called obwiko. It was formally recognised by performing a certain ceremony as follows: After the two had quarrelled violently, they would swear openly saying: ‘While I live, I will never again enter your house,’ or ‘I will never cross your threshold again.’ Then they performed the separation act of holding a handful of lemon grass (etete ), which they cut into two with a sharp knife. From that time the two had officially severed their relationship. They would avoid one another and would not have any further social contact. They were never again to drink at the same beer party, or share the same meal. If any such close contact took place, the man who had been to blame for severing the relationship would die."
561,"The spirit possession (kubandwa ) ceremony. This occurs as an initation ceremony, during wedding rites and at various other times in order to remove particular substances or plants from the household. The day the Mbandwa ceremony took place was a day of great festivity and all the members of the clan gathered there. The neighbours arrived, dressed in their best clothes. Throughout the night the throbbing sound of the ntimbo drums could be heard, and the nsegu flutes blared away non-stop. By morning, the whole atmosphere was charged with singing and loud, happy cheering, while the special Mbandwa dance (ijanja ) steadily increased in intensity, until, finally, the spirit split open the ground and appeared (literally “fell”) like a miracle. The women donned garlands of omuihura plant and kept strolling up and down, holding and shaking their spears and shields like men at war and making sounds like cows calling their young. All this was done as a sign of respect for the Mbandwa, until it caused the medium to fall, twist, and then come out into the open. His head would be adorned with an akasonko headdress; this is a band of very small, white snail-shells. Throughout that night, both the female and male mediums as well as ntimbo drummers and nseegu flute players would stay in the diviner's room or hut, indulging in sexual intercourse while some of them carried on the singing, dancing, and making noises in order to conceal from the layman or non-initiate, what was actually taking place inside."
562,"The initiation into the Mbandwa cult was always accompanied by a great deal of feasting. For a household head to throw such a feast, he had to be fully prepared to meet the great outlay expected of him. The beginning of this ritual follows the pattern of the kubandwa ritual (above). On the following morning, the mediums, the initiate and the senior ntimbo drummers went to the ‘small bush’ (akasaka ); no one else was allowed to go there. The mediums, carrying small sticks from the musinga tree, spread a barkcloth on the ground and made the novice sit on it. Then they placed the small sticks on his lap, together with their headgear, and proceeded to admonish him never to give away the secrets of the Mbandwa cult. One of them took hold of a spear, and after wrapping its blade with the stem of a convolvulus (ekiboha ), threatened to push it down the novice's throat. At the same time, the novice was constantly being asked: ‘What have you swallowed?’ He had to reply: ‘You have swallowed the Cwezi Spirit’. Then he was made to swallow a small pebble called ‘the pebble of the oath’, and was forced to do many other things. Throughout this part of the ceremony, the novice was warned and threatened thus: ‘If you ever give away the Mbandwa secrets, you'll be struck by lightning’. It is said that during this ceremony in the ‘small bush’ the senior mediums became extremely aggressive and reckless and that they could even kill a person. Finally, they all returned sedately to the homestead. There, in front of the house, near the trees of the main gate, they met a museegu (senior officiant) standing with his legs wide apart, and they had to crawl under him. The initiate's Mbandwa grandmother (also a senior officiant) then brought out a bag in which she had all the mediums' regalia, as well as some seeds called echukachuki, some button mushrooms and some millet. Particular dishes are prepared and eaten."
563,"Annual ceremony of the blessing of the country. This lasted two days. The chief priest with three assistant priests, three chiefs, of whom Bamuroga was the head, and the queen were the only persons permitted to be present during the whole of this ceremony, though another wife of the king had to be present at one point to carry a pot of beer. After the king had drunk the evening milk and the Nkorogi herd had been milked, a white cow, a white sheep, and a white fowl were brought before him, and he looked at them to see that they were in perfect condition before he accepted them for the ceremony. The priest, who had already examined the animals, took them away and guarded them during the night, and in the morning, after the milk ceremonies had been attended to, he brought them again to the door of the throne-room. The cow, then the sheep, and lastly the fowl were killed by having their throats cut, and the blood was caught in a vessel. The right shoulders were cut from the cow and the sheep and the meat cut into small pieces and cooked. Meanwhile the king stood at the door of the throne-room, holding the spear, Kinegena, and looking on in silence. When the meat was cooked some was put on the spear and he raised it up towards heaven with a prayer. The priest next handed the king two bunches of sacred herbs. These he dipped into the vessel of blood and repeated the prayer, sprinkling the blood upwards. A wife of the king, a woman of the Mukwonga clan, now came with a pot of beer, the priests carried the pot of blood and a basket with the cooked meat, and the king went to four places within the royal enclosure. At each place he put down a little meat, took some of the beer in his mouth and blew it over the meat, which he then sprinkled with blood. The party returned to the throne-room and for the rest of the two days the king did not transact any business and saw no one except those who had taken part in the ceremony."
564,
565,"At or about the time of year when the king had been buried, the reigning king told Bamuroga to prepare a feast for the departed king. Bamuroga chose a poor man of the Babito clan to impersonate the dead king, and the man so chosen lived in regal state in the king's tomb and was called by the name of the monarch he represented, for he was said to be the old king revived. He lived in the tomb, was feasted and honoured, and had full use of the women of the tomb, the widows of the old king. The king sent him presents and he sent his blessing to the king, the country, and the cattle. He distributed gifts of cows belonging to the king as he pleased, and for eight days lived like a king. When the ninth day came he was taken away to the back of the tomb and strangled, and no one heard anything more about him. This was an annual ceremony."
566,
567,"Punèn puénégètat, initiation of new members of the uma. The ceremony began with the rimata beating the ngong (gong). All those who submitted themselves to the rituals entered the uma via the front entrance, first the women and the girls, then the men and the boys. The males sat down in the tenga'n uma, the women on their baladjat (near the k'ut uma ). Those who had already been initiated also entered the uma, but went no further than the front room. Again the rimata beat the gong; the drums were beaten by initiated men. Then the rimata, with the juice of various kinds of ginger, spat upon the chests of all the men and boys to be initiated; sometimes this was done by the sikaute. Ginger has a strong, acrid taste; the meaning of the ceremony was to make the candidates “strong of heart” (brave?). The women looked on. When the gong was beaten again, the women went outside via the front exit. The candidates among them waited in the yard of the uma. They were spat upon with ginger-juice by an initiated women (sometimes by the rimata 's wife). It also happened that several women together performed this initiation, because otherwise the spitting could become too tiring for one person (probably this also applied to the initiation of the men). For the initiation of girls and women the ailèppèt (Graptophyllum hortense?; cf. Maass 1902, 165) was used, a leaf of a kind which was said to be “cooling”. The meaning of the spitting was for the women and girls to be adopted into the community. After this ceremony, the gong was beaten again and all went to the tenga'n uma via the k'ut uma. When they had gathered there, the rimata prepared a silimèn (sacrificial meal), with yam and eggs as its ingredients. The prepared food was served in a wooden trough ( lulak ), but not until some of it had been offered, first to the Batukérébau, then to the punèn ( buluat ) was the rest eaten by the people, except for the newly initiated, who did not get anything. Only those who had undergone punèn puénégètat were allowed to partake of the ritual meals (it is not clear whether this applied only to men). In the meantime, everybody, young and old, were tattood with a particular motif, the pulètsuat."
568,"Big Punen. The punen is the celebration attended by all of the members of the uma, men, women, and children. Among the occasions on which punen are held may be included: the building of a new communal house ( uma ), the choice of a new priest, the making of a new field, the spilling of blood within the village, an epidemic in the village, when a tree falls in the community, and after the killing of a sacrificial animal, monkey, deer or sea-turtle. The duration of a punen at the time of the founding of a, new uma or at the election of a new priest is so long (lasting at least nine years) that these two events are usually held simultaneously. If a priest dies, his successor is not chosen until a new uma is erected, and some married man fills the position temporarily. A punen is initiated by the ceremonial washing of the hair of the participants, and the adoption of gala decorations. All work in the fields is then stopped, and strangers are denied access to the uma. The main ceremonial acts of every punen are the slaughter of pigs and chickens, accompanied by the sacrifice of the livers and haruspication. During the invocation accompanying every sacrifice, the souls of the people of the uma are invoked to return and remain by their owners. During the first nights of the punen, dancing takes place by the seers. The dance is for the purpose of pleasing the spirits, and is held in imitation of various birds and animals. During the latter part of the punen, hunts for monkeys and deer are made, and the sea-turtle is sought for by placing large nets. During the time of punen the men sleep in the uma, for all sexual intercourse is taboo."
569,"Small punen or lia. Family or personal punen, are held at the time of sickness in the household, marriage, adoption of children, the making of a boat or family field, etc."
570,"The members of the uma gather in families around the well-filled bowls of food. The head of the family takes a little piece of food and drops it between the floorboards of the pile-house, saying “With blessings” ( tulu ); “With blessings” the others respond, and they start eating. This little piece of food is the ancestors ‘share’ ( otsai ), to which they are just as entitled as the living, and which in this way documents their membership of the group."
571,"At first, everyone sits peacefully; a few gently sing a song to the ancestors. Then the women roll out a large mat which covers the entire dance-floor. The flowers are strewn over the carpet, and little wooden boxes, in which the families keep their ornaments and their cloths, are placed beside them. The boxes are opened and their contents invitingly displayed to view. The master of ceremonies, the rimata, stands in the entrance to the house by the veranda and calls into the inside of the house: “Come, come, o ancestors, let us bedeck ourselves with flowers, come all of you!” While the ancestors are decorating themselves, the living continue singing songs to them, and some start sobbing quietly as they become conscious of the presence of their deceased relatives. This lasts about half an hour. Then, hesitantly, the living also begin to decorate themselves. Suddenly, as if a sign had been given, they all dash towards the flowers, the children in front, and adorn themselves as beautifully as possible. In the meantime, further spectators have arrived, and they too adorn themselves; again the dancing continues until dawn. In contrast with the dances on other occasions, each one of these dances is introduced with a song to the ancestors. The ancestors join in with the dancing, and their movements make the medicine-men so giddy that they continually fall down in a trance. Men who are not medicine-men, women and even children may also take part in these dances. For some four weeks thereafter, this spectacle is repeated every second night, each occasion being separated from the next by a night's rest. Throughout this time pigs are continually slaughtered and served up at banquets. Not until the final day, however, is it the turn of the big castrated hogs ( babui ) from the estate of the newly deceased. On this day the flowers have been laid out by midday. The son of the deceased sings, tears streaming from his eyes, while the meat from his father's swine is distributed: “Alas, father, thus he dies whom you reared. Even though you have become the wind in the sky, yet we have borrowed you.”"
572,"A boy begins seeking an arutam soul at about the age of six years. Accompanied most commonly by his father, he makes a pilgrimage to the sacred waterfall in his neighborhood. This is always the highest waterfall within a few days' travel. It is believed to be the rendezvous of these souls or spirits which wander about as breezes, scattering the spray of the long cascade. During the day, the vision seekers “bathe” in the waterfall by striding back and forth under its cold and drenching canopy, actually walking between the downpour and the cliff from which it is dropping. They walk naked and shivering, and in some danger from falling logs which may be swept over the cliff with the current. Each paces with the aid of a magical balsa wood staff carved for the occasion, and chants, “tau, tau, tau, ” continually. By night the pilgrims sleep near the falls in a simple lean-to. Here they fast, drink tobacco water (made by steeping green tobacco leaves in cold water), and await the appearance of an arutam. They may keep up this fasting, “bathing,” and tobacco water drinking for as long as five days. If unsuccessful, they return home to make another attempt at a later date. More likely, though, is that before the five days are up, one of the members of the party will have recourse to drinking hallucinogenic maikua (Datura arborea ) juice. Usually this is a person who has failed to see an arutam on a previous vision quest or who feels an urgent need to see one without delay. Upon acquiring this arutam soul, the person feels a sudden power surge into his body, accompanied by a new self-confidence. The arutam soul is supposed to increase a person's power in the most general sense. This power, called kakarma, is believed to increase one's intelligence as well as simple physical strength, and also to make it difficult for the soul possessor to lie or commit other dishonorable acts. His newly acquired power increases his resistance to contagious disease to some degree, but most important, it makes it impossible for him to die as a result of any physical violence or sorcery. Most of his relatives and acquaintances shortly know that he has acquired an arutam soul simply because of the change in his personality. For example, he especially tends to speak with great forcefulness"
573,"In the adjacent forest, the sons build small lean-to's, each about 300 yards away in the four cardinal directions. Each night a son can come to the abandoned house to seek an arutam soul created by the dead father which, hopefully, is wandering in the vicinity. The seeker must come alone, without a copal torch, and in the utter darkness of the house touch the magical staff, follow it with his hand until he contacts the dead man's chest, and say, “I am your son, Father.” He then goes out of the house to the north lean-to where he drinks tobacco water (nothing stronger is used) and awaits an arutam for about two hours. If none appears, he returns to the house, repeats the ritual and goes to the south lean-to, where he takes more tobacco water. The same procedure is repeated for the east and west lean-to's, dawn finding the arutam seeker at the last place unless he has already been successful. On the subsequent night, another son, or even a son-in-law of the deceased, may visit the corpse, explain his kin relationship and attempt to see an arutam. According to several accounts, the vision is often seen not only in the lean-to's, but in the house, where the arutam souls are believed to come back to visit. Usually the corpse is left in this upright position only two days and then buried in the usual manner, although there are cases where it has been left longer."
574,"The dinner of the Milpa, u hanli col. By performing it the agriculturalist establishes satisfactory relations with the chaacs, balams and kuilob kaaxob. The ceremony secures him wealth and health: the beneficence of the yuntzilob assures him a good harvest; and if it be omitted, they will bring sickness upon him. It is recognized that one should perform the ceremony every four years, at a time when the maize is just ripening. But many men neglect the ceremony until sickness reminds them of their remissness. As in the other ceremonies, the h-men begins by clearing a piece of land 15 or 20 meters square. As this ceremony is performed at the initiative of some one man, the clearing is made in the yard of his house. The usual altar is erected, covered with habin leaves and provided with a small wooden cross. The h-men begins by offering zaca to the gods, asperging the altar with it using a leaf of habin, and reciting a prayer which invites the yuntzilob to the feast that they are about to prepare. An oven is prepared and sacral bread are put in to cook. While the sacred breads are baking, the h-men offers balche to the gods. The h-men recites a prayer inviting the gods to come and partake of the liquor. After a pause, to allow the deities to do this, the balche is distributed among those present. No one may refuse to drink at least a little. The second dedicatory act is the consecration and offering of fowl. The consecration is accomplished by the recitation of a short prayer by the h-men while he puts balche down the victim's beak with a scoop of habin. The h-men is supposed to have supernatural knowledge as to when the breadstuffs in the oven are done. When he is satisfied as to this, they are removed and arranged by the h-men on the altar in a special and symmetrical arrangement. The breadstuffs of a certain kind (nabal-uah) are broken into the clear broth prepared from the fowls, making a thick mixture referred to as kol, chocob, or yacħ. Four pails of these soups are distributed on the altar. The cumulative point of the ceremony has now arrived. The h-men lights two candles and, placing grains of incense on a dish holding live coals, incenses the altar. He then kneels in front of the altar. On each side of him kneel two special assistants (idzacob), named by him without formality from among the participants. As he kneels he recites a prayer that is the longest of those used in the ceremony. Although the texts used by different h-mens differ, thy all summon the spirits to partake in the offerings. During the prayer the two idzacs sprinkle the altar with balche. Then the h-men, with the aid of the idzacs (and sometimes of four other men), lifts the offerings from the table, one by one, and as he holds each up he recites a short prayer (Nos. 9 and 10, pp. 347–348) dedicating that breadstuff to the gods, afterward setting it again upon the altar (Plate 12 a ). Everyone then withdraws a short distance from the altar, while the gods, now present in response to the invocation, take the gracia of the food. At the end of this period the h-men moves the foods from the altar to an ordinary table, where he blesses them with the usual phrase “u kaba Dios yumbil, Dios mehenbil, Dios Espíritu Santo. Amen ” (“In the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Amen”). The food is divided among all present, the h-men retaining the largest share, and a feast ensues."
575,"Dinner of the bees. Parallel to the u hanli col ceremony (see the dinner of the Milpa – above), in both meaning and form, is a ceremony known as u hanli cab (“dinner of the bees”). As the former ceremony is supposed to be performed at certain intervals to propitiate the gods of the milpa, so the bee ceremony is supposed to be performed every four years to propitiate the gods of the bees, and the ceremonies are alike in that they are often deferred until the sickness of the owner reminds him to perform them. On the evening before the ceremony, the h-men invites the lords of the bees to be present next day. On the usual altar he places thirteen homa of zaca, sweetened with honey. After the invocation has been uttered, the men present wait for an hour or two, till the gods shall have taken the gracia of the zaca. The order of the ritual is as usual: the offering of zaca, then of balche, the consecration of the fowl, the placing of the foods on the altar, the dedication of the foods to the gods, and finally their consumption by participants in the ceremony."
576,"Fixing the place for the hives, u hedz luumil cab. As in the other ceremonies (see The dinner of the Milpa and the dinner of the bees, above), the h-men appoints two men to act as idzacs; the giver of the ceremony is usually one of these. Standing between these two, the h-men offers the food to the gods, reciting a prayer calling upon each of the classes of beé-gods. Then the h-men and the two idzacs, carrying one homa of balche, the five large breads, two of the yal-uah, and one pail of kol, move nine times around the hives, the idzacs sprinkling balche and some of the kol on the hives, while the h-men repeats the same prayer."
577,"The New House Ceremony. The ceremony is exceptional in that it is not performed out of doors, but inside the house. That is because not the yuntzilob, but the house itself is the object of propitiation. The altar is erected in the middle of the room. To each of the four corner posts (ocom) the h-men suspends a gourd vessel of zaca. Then the owner of the house holds a live hen, and the h-men offers it to each of the two ocoms at one end of the house; and another hen is offered to the other two ocoms. The hens are then consecrated with rum, and strangled and prepared into broth. On the altar are placed a candle, a cross, two gourd dishes containing the boiled fowl, two pails of kol made with nine pim-pim-uah, two small vessels of zaca, a bowl of rum, and a cloth containing twenty-five ordinary tortillas. The h-men recites prayers and offers each of the foods successively to the poles composing the house. He begins with the ocoms, and then goes successively to the other poles in order of size. Special attention is given to the tiseras “because they bear the weight,” and “because they have the form of crosses.” In some houses three of the uinciche at each end of the house are bound together by means of a short horizontal piece, forming a very evident cross. These two crosses are given special attention and are regarded as the particular guardians of the house. Some h-mens advise that this piece be left out of new houses, because the crosses are the most demanding and would be most offended should u cħuyenil na not be made. Offerings are also made to the many small crosses formed by small withes transverse to the uinciche."
578,"At dawn, after a short intermission for sleep, the h-men filled thirteen homa and two shallow gourd vessels with balche and offered it to the gods with the same prayer used on the analogous occasion in the u hanli col ceremony. When the hens had been collected, they were sanctified and dedicated to the gods. As described in connection with the u hanli col, the h-men put balche down the beak of each, meanwhile repeating a prayer, the idzacs wringing each fowl's neck and then handing the h-men another. In this way twenty-three fowl were sacrificed. The prayer used here declares that there is offered to the chaacs (and to Saint Michael) a “holy virgin animal”. The prayer is in nine parts; in each of the last eight parts the h-men counted the nine times he tossed the liquor down the bird's throat. The moment had now come to deliver the feast to the gods and to make more explicit the prayer for rain. The h-men fastened four boys under the table-altar, each tied by the right foot to one post of the altar. These were the “frogs.” He then selected one of the older men to impersonate the kunku-chaac, chief of the raingods. The two idzacs and two other men lifted this man up and carried him to a specially cleared space about 8 meters east of the altar—the “Trunk of Heaven” (chun-caan), where the kunku-chaac is thought to dwell. This was done with care and reverence and in such a manner that none turned his back to the altar, for now all the yuntzilob were there gathered. An idzac supplied the impersonator with a calabash and a wooden machete. The calabash represents those used by the raingods in watering the corn, and the wooden knife stands for that brandished object known as lelem, with which the raingods produce the lightning. The kunku-chaac was left by himself, his bearers returning to the altar. The h-men knelt before it, with an idzac on either side, and repeated the prayer summoning the gods and invoking the various place-names of the region. As the h-men prayed, the idzacs were sprinkling the altar with balche and adding grains of incense to a small brazier; the “frogs” were croaking a particular note special to such occasions, and the kunku-chaac from time to time rose to his feet and with his voice imitated the sound of thunder, and with his lelem the flash of lightning. When the prayer was over, the h-men summoned four men to help him lift the food from the altar, and he consecrated it, bit by bit, to the gods. Then (as this particular h-men was wont to do in the u hanli col ceremony), he ceremonially drank balche and the other particiapants followed him in draining a homa of balche. This ended, all went some distance from the altar, keeping complete silence so as not to interrupt the feasting of the gods, now enjoying the gracia of the tuti-uah and the kol. Afterward the h-men built one of the little racks used to make minor offerings, consisting of two horizontal poles bound to two vertical ones, and on this placed thirteen dishes of zaca, offering them to the deities with the prayer first used in the ceremony."

580,"The new corn ceremony is made by each separate agriculturalist. The ceremony is one for which the h-men is needed. The owner of the milpa invites a group of his friends to make new roasted ears. They come together in his cornfield and harvest the first ears, which they carry to some spot beside the road leading to the milpa, but outside the village. The h-men accompanies them. At this spot, just beside the path, they dig a pit for the earth-oven. When the stones have become hot, upon them are laid bark of habin and cħoy or of tzalam and bohom, so that the new ears will not burn. The ears of maize, wrapped in their husks, are laid upon this bark and the pib is closed, as usual, with leaves and earth. A cross is then made of corn stalks and laid on the soft earth that covers the roasting ears. It is immediately raised again to a vertical position just east of the pib, but it leaves a cross-shaped depression in the earth. “This cross gives notice to the gods of the milpa, in case of the sickness of the owner, that the sickness is not deserved, because he has made offering of pibil-nal to the kunku-chaac, the balamob and the kuilob-kaaxob who guard the milpa.” The earth-oven is made after nightfall. At about three in the morning the men gather to open it. No woman may be present. First the h-men erects behind the pib one of those small altars made of four poles. The cross of corn stalks is removed from the pib and placed on this altar. Then the pib is opened. If all the bark that was put on the stones has been burned to charcoal, it is a sign that the owner of the milpa will soon suffer from a fever. The first twenty-six ears of corn that are taken from the ground are hung from the horizontal poles of the altar in thirteen pairs, the husks of each pair being tied together. The other men stand back, while the h-men recites a short prayer. The thirteen pairs of ears are usually eaten then and there. Another thirteen pairs are taken for the second part of the ceremony that follows in the yard of the owner's house. The corn-stalk cross is taken to the pile of stones on that road that marks the entrance to the village and one of the four “corners” of the pueblo over which watches one of the four guardian balams."
581,"See other notes for more information. In the early part of July 1930, Don Madal determined to offer a novena to God as an expression of his gratitude for the luxuriant growth of his milpa, and to invoke His aid to secure the full development of the maize plants. Don Madal asked Don Guillermo, a maestro cantor, to recite the prayers. The women of his household prepared the altar and the offerings. On an ordinary table, they placed a small wooden cross, a plaster image of the Niño Dios (which Don Madal owned), two gourd vessels of cooked fowl, a plate of tortillas, five gourd dishes of maize atole, and five lighted candles. When Don Guillermo arrived, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, several friends and relatives were gathered, seated on chairs or small wooden benches. The women of the household were making tortillas at the end of the room distant from the table. Don Guillermo knelt, made the sign of the cross and began reciting the prayer, an “act of contrition” or “act of sorrow for sin.” This took several minutes. He then began a recital of a rosary, in which the others present joined him. After the first twenty words of the first “Our Father” he seated himself, and the congregation continued the prayer. Don Guillermo then began a Hail Mary, which the congregation similarly completed. In this antiphonal fashion was completed a rosary of five groups, each of one “Our Father,” ten “Hail Marys,” and one “Gloria.” After each group was interpolated a sung strophe and antistrophe—the sanctus of the mass—Don Guillermo and his son (also a maestro cantor ) singing: “ Santo, santo, santo, santo, Señor Dios de los ejercitos, Llenos estan los cielos y la tierra, de vuestra Gloria. ” To which the others sang the customary response: “ Gloria al Padre, Gloria al Hijo, Gloria al Espíritu Santo. ” When this group of prayers had been concluded, Don Guillermo recited the anthem “Salve Regina” (like the preceding prayers and anthem, in Spanish). Don Guillermo repeated the verses in praise of the Virgin, to each of which the congregation gave the customary reply: “ Santa María, Madre de Dios, ruega, Señora, por nosotros pecadores, ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte. Amen. ” The leader then recited the Apostles' Creed, and the congregation repeated it after him. After this Don Guillermo recited the Litany of the Blessed Virgin, the litany being in Latin. After each line of the fifty or more praising Mary, the chorus repeated “ Ora pro nobis, ” and this took many minutes to complete. When it was over Don Guillermo recited a prayer to God the Father in which the others took no part; they occupied themselves meanwhile with subdued conversation on mundane topics. In the last part of the novena Don Guillermo and his son sang four vernacular hymns, three to the Sacred Heart and one to Jesus. The last chant concluded, all present stood up, and with hands folded together at the breast, and heads bowed, they another hymn Don Guillermo then said “ Gloria al Padre, Gloria al Hijo, al Espíritu Santo. Amen. Immediately the people wished each other a good night, the women making tortillas leaving their work to join the others and do this. Then Don Madal and his wife took the dishes of food from the table and served those present; eating and conversation became general; some food was sent to houses of neighbors. As soon as the food was consumed, all persons not members of the household took their leave, saying—as is always said on such occasions—“ Dios bootic tech, tat” (“God reward you, sir”)."
582,"The rezo is held in commemoration of the death of a member of the family. Theoretically, one should be held on each of the following occasions: seven days, seven weeks, seven months and one year after the death; and on each occasion (or at least at the anniversary) the prayers should be recited at the hour at which the death occurred. The prayers recited include a rosary and litanies for the dead: if for an adult, Oid Mortales; Perdón, O Dios Mio; and Adios, Jesús del Cielo; if for a child, then only the Sube, Sube. Instead of atole, which is appropriate for a novena, chocolate is served at a rezo. But at the more important rezos (seven months and anniversary), boiled fowl may be served. The anniversary (cabo del año) is often the occasion for making breads in the earth-oven (pibil-uah) and some make pibil-uah at the rezo of the seven months. These commemorative rezos are, of course, never communal, but always familial."
583,
584,"U novenai u kino kaba (“novena on the name-day”). This is given every year on the name-day of the santo, by the person or the community that has the santo; and it is thought dangerous to omit it. There are only a few novenas of this sort in Chan Kom: one corresponding to each of the different santos owned by persons in the community. Until recent years, only two of these name-day novenas were full novenarios: that of the patron (San Diego) and that of the Holy Cross. Both were (and still are) performed by the whole village, for the common good. As is the rule with novenarios, these are cooperative affairs, in which responsibility for the arrangements, including the refreshments with which each evening concludes, is distributed among a group of people. The first novena in the series takes place on the eighth day before the day commemorated, and the last novena (evening of prayer), regarded as the most important, occurs on the evening of the day itself. Until recently, all the other name-day novenas were observed merely by a double prayer (vespers and matins) celebrated as a private undertaking by the owner of the santo."
585,"The first of these rituals (dza akab) takes account of the perilous meeting of man and bull in the rustic bull-fight. In the villages of the region, the annual fiesta usually includes four jaranas, each undertaken by a cargador. The actual conduct of these jaranas is in charge of two functionaries known as the nohoch mayol and (his assistant) the chan mayol. These men direct the musicians and lead the dancers on to the dancing-floor. The nohoch mayol gets two h-mens to come to his house on the night of the last jarana. In the yard of this house these h-mens offer two gourd-vessels of zaca to the yuntzilob of the village and to X-Juan-Thul. The balams are asked to be present that night to protect the vaqueros and the vaqueras from the evil winds. The night when ends the last jarana is the night before the corrida de toros. When the jarana is over, the vaqueros accompany the nohoch mayol to attend the offering of zaca to the yuntzilob. They spend the rest of the night in the company of one another, without sleeping and under the supervision of the nohoch mayol. This is “vigil” (ppix-ich). The remainder of the night is spent in more or less equal parts in the houses of the four cargadores. These houses are visited in the order in which occurred the jaranas for which each is respectively responsible. At each house a bottle of rum and a package of cigarettes await the men, and more of both are furnished from time to time, so that as they go from house to house there is apt to be a good deal of shouting and uproar. The h-mens tell them that they must not sleep, because “the yuntzilob are present,” and above all that they must not go home to sleep with their wives. If the vaqueros return to their homes at all during the night and day of the corrida, they leave their lassos outside the door, because they are filled with evil winds, which it would be dangerous to bring into the house. They always keep their ropes with them. The spending of the night in this way is referred to as dza akab ti lazo dzuytal zuun yoklal ma u thoocol tumen toros (“give the night to the lasso, twisting it thick so that it will not break on account of the bulls”)."
586,"The ceremony known as hadz pach (“strike the back”) takes place after the corrida ends. At the first jarana the girl-dancers wear men's hats; at the remaining three, they do not. But after the corrida there takes place that night a short jarana, spoken of as “half a night”—“to finish off with.” No cargador is responsible for this jarana. At this dance the girls wear hats again. When it is over, vaqueros and vaqueras go to the house of the nohoch mayol, where a table is arranged, with a bottle of rum, cigarettes and leaves of zipche. At the table sit the nohoch mayol and the two h-mens. The vaqueros place their lassos under the table. Each vaquero brings the nohoch mayol a medida of rum. Each vaquera is brought to the table, and the chan mayol begins striking her back with a rope made by twisting together three of the large handkerchiefs such as are used by the men and as are employed in the torito dance. Because sometimes the men are drunk and the mayol may hit rather hard, a vaquero may volunteer to substitute for a vaquera and receive the beating instead. After the strokes have been administered, the girl (or her substitute) passes to the h-mens. One gives her a drink of rum, while the other strokes her head with zipche, praying to expel the evil winds. The h-men first moves the zipche in a clockwise direction; then he gives a smaller drink and moves the zipche in a counterclockwise direction. Then the second h-men takes rum in his mouth and blows some on the girl's head. It is the abnormal physical and mental conditions of excitement and of fatigue, and especially the unusual association of the sexes in the dance, that is objectified in the thought of evil winds; hadz pach is lustration and restoration to the normal and the ordinary. After the vaqueras have been cleansed of the evil winds, the h-mens again offer zaca to X-Juan-Thul and the greater yuntzilob, to tell them that hadz pach has been made."
587,"The santiguar, curing ritual. When the h-men arrives to treat a person afflicted with the winds, he is given rum to drink, and he then directs the members of the household to bring certain plants. Zipche is apparently always one of these. No altar is prepared for the ceremony, because no foods are to be offered. If the sick person is able, he sits on a little bench beside the h-men. The plants to be used are sometimes spread out on a little table. If the patient cannot sit, the h-men goes to his hammock. He prays, asking the aid of San Lazaro, San Roque and the Virgin Asunción, and ordering the winds to depart. Meanwhile he brushes the sick person with zipche. He may take into his mouth some rum and spray a little around the hammock or on the head and in the eyes of the patient. Then he brushes the hammock and the house-posts with the zipche. The herbs that he has used he then takes some distance from the house and throws them all away. The winds have now been cast out and, to prevent their return, he tosses after them, in a motion that makes the sign of the cross, a little rum. On re-entering the house, he says “Good afternoon” (or evening, etc.). The sick person's clothing is changed and carried out to the washing-table."
588,"Kex. The kex is a promise of a return to be made to the winds if they abandon their victim, the patient. If the patient recovers, the winds have fulfilled their part of the bargain, and it is then necessary to make kex. If he does not get better, it is not necessary; but it may be made anyway. The ceremony takes place, ordinarily, at midnight. The h-men comes Friday evening. The owner of the house has prepared three cuartillos of maize and a cuartillo of ground squash seed, and a turkey or other fowl. In the early part of the evening the h-men offers the fowl to the winds. This he does by holding it over the head of the sick person while praying an offertory prayer. If the sick person is a man, a pullet must be used; if a woman, a cockerel. It is usual to strangle the fowl as it is being held over the patient's head. At midnight the table of food is offered. On top of the table are placed the offerings for the three santos: two dishes each containing a boiled fowl (one of these is to be eaten by the sick person and the members of the family, and the other by the h-men), two napkins, each containing thirteen cham-cham-uah and two dishes of kol, and branches of zipche. Underneath the table is placed the special food for the winds—that which is to be exchanged for the sick person. These foods are a dish containing the viscera, beak, comb, claws and feathers of the fowl earlier offered to the winds, and a bottle of rum with a glass. The h-men prays, delivering the table to the three saints and to the winds. Then the articles under the table are carried outside the house and some distance from it and thrown away. The h-men says that thereby the winds, that have come for their dinner, are returned again to the sea (kanab). Before returning to the house the h-men tosses the rum after the other articles. This is called kal pach (“shutting the door on the back”). The h-men repeats this process twice, once about a mecate from the house and once just at the door. This is called “making two locks” (kalal). On entering the house, the h-men says, “Good evening.” The food on top of the table is distributed and consumed. After this a santiguar is performed, to get rid of any winds that may remain."
589,"Loh-cahtali (“redemption of a settlement”) performed in 1929 at the milperío of Sahcabchen was occasioned by epizootic among the animals of the milperos who were wont to stay at this place while working in their fields. The h-men announced that the evil winds had been brought to the place by the alux, whose presence was evident from the existence nearby of mounds containing ancient ruins. He therefore erected a large altar for the protecting balams and a small one for the ill-natured alux. Ritual breads were prepared, fowls consecrated and kol made, as in the u hanli col, cħa-chaac and u hanli cab. On the large altar the h-men placed most of the ritual breads, the large pots of kol and thirteen homa of balche. On the smaller altar he put one noh-uah and thirteen shells of the wine-palm filled with balche. These foods were offered to the balams and to the alux. By consulting his zaztun (divination stone), the h-men determined where the alux were to be found. Most of the night he consumed in repeating the prayers, in drinking rum, and in repeatedly consulting the zaztun. At last he learned where the final offering was to be made. At dawn all the men present, carrying candles, followed the h-men to a small mound which, by reason of the hewn stones forming a stairway in one of its faces, must have been a temple-structure in ancient times. The h-men explained that in this mound the alux were hidden. Bidding the others remain at a little distance, the h-men alone ascended the steps, carrying the noh-uah and the little shells of balche. In a short while he returned to his followers without them and announced that he had calmed the anger of the alux. Satisfied, all returned to the altars, where, just as the sun rose, began the feasting with which all ceremonies conclude."
590,"Pledge of compadre relationship. When parents of a recently born child request another couple to carry it to baptism, they go to ask a great favor and to propose the establishment between the two couples of the significant and unbreakable relationship of compadre. Such solemn petitions, in the thinking of the people, should not be delivered directly, but through an intermediary. The father of the child therefore asks, to accompany him and his wife to the house of the other, some friend, a respected man of mature years. When they together enter the house, the friend, the father and the mother successively kiss the hand of the godfather-elect. The latter places his thumb over his first finger, forming a cross; and this the others kiss, bowing as they do so. The friend then addresses the owner of the house with a prescribed speech, if the other is willing to act as godfather, he replies in a prescribed manner. When this consent has been received, the father withdraws and returns to his house or to some other place where he has already made ready the offering, acceptance of which is to seal the agreement. The accompanying friend provides a table, and upon this are placed four reales of wheat bread, ten tablets of chocolate, one kilo of sugar, two bottles of rum (or soft drink substitute), a package of cigarettes and two candles. The table is carried into the house of the godparents. One of the candles is lighted. The friend and the father of the child then stand and the godfather does likewise. The friend kisses first the hand of the father and then that of the godfather, and delivers the table with the following speech: The godfather accepts the gift. The friend again kisses the hand of each, and all are seated. The godfather-designate directs his wife to take the gifts from the table and to make chocolate with the tablets provided. There is general conversation, and the chocolate and bread are served, and the rum or other liquid refreshment drunk. After this, the godfather puts back on the table the napkin in which the bread was brought, and the empty bottles. He kisses the hand of the friend, and with another short, formal speech, delivers these articles back to his visitor. The father then takes the napkin and the bottles, and bidding the others good-night, leaves with his wife and his friend."
591,"Formal Baptism Ceremony. As the baptismal act itself is performed by an outsider, a priest of the town, the form of the ritual is something with which the folk have no concern. Often the parents do not attend, and the meal served by the parents to the compadres immediately after the baptism is a simple dinner of boiled fowl, served without ceremony."
592,"The hand washing ceremony. About a year after the birth of the child, and after the baptism, is held a ceremony in which the parents acknowledge their gratitude to their compadres. The ceremony is known as tzicil (“to pay respects”), or is referred to as “the washing of the compadre's hand”. The parents make ready their house for the coming of their compadres. They place four chairs beside a table. On the table are placed a cross, two candles—to each of which are bound a Plumeria (nicte) flower and a leaf of tabasco pepper, and one of which is lighted—and a gourd dish containing water and flowers. This last is for “the washing of the hands” (x-ppobom-kab). To each of the posts which form the outer edges of the backs of the chairs is fastened a Plumeria flower with a leaf of tabasco pepper. The godfather finds a friend to accompany him. On this occasion this friend is known as the cħapach. These two men and their wives are seated in the chairs and the parents, first the man and then the woman, kneel in front of these, kissing the hand of each and saying, “Cici thantabac cichcelem yum, tat (colel),” “Sweetly (respectfully) be addressed, fair sir (madam).” Then each parent washes the hands of each of the other four, using the water with the flowers. The vessel is then passed to any others present, who dip their hands in it. Usually, then, someone named as kuleb—functionary to distribute refreshments at a fiesta—offers rum and cigarettes to all. On some occasions a meal is served."
593,"Hetzek ritual. Up to the age of three or four months infants are carried lying across the mother's arm. Thereafter, and until the child walks well enough to keep up with adults, it is carried astride the left hip of its mother or older sister, whose left arm supports it in this position. The first time the child is placed in this position is the occasion of a domestic ceremony known by the phrase describing this manner of carrying a child: “to make hetzmek” (hetzmek tah). The ritual is supposed to awaken the physical and intellectual faculties of the child and make him useful for the future. By spreading his legs on the hip of her who carries him, he is made ready to walk long distances. The rest of the ceremony assures his competence at the tasks that life will demand of him. The father hands his child to the godfather and says, “Here is the child, so you may do it the favor of making hetzmek, sir.” The godfather takes the child and puts it astride his hip. He then goes nine times around the table, at each circuit taking one of the objects from the table and putting it into the hand of the child while he utters an admonishment according to the character of the object. Thus, on the first trip around the table he takes up the book, and says, “Here you have a book. Take it so that you may learn to read” (He yantech hunppel libroe. Cħae utial a canic xoc). Thus he does with each object—the pencil and the notebook, so the child may learn to write; the catechism, so he may learn to pray; the hammer, that he may learn to work; the hatchet, that he may learn to fell bush; the bread, that he may “learn to eat everything” the boiled fowl, that he may learn to eat “good food”; the coins, that he may learn to earn money. He then hands the child to the godmother, telling her to make hetzmek with it; and she does as he has already done. It is also customary for the godmother, on each of the trips around the table, to eat one of nine squash seeds which have been placed on the table. “As the squash seed is opened to expose its soft interior, so will the mind of the child be opened.” When the squash seeds are used up, the godmother has finished her task; she returns the child to the godfather, saying, “Well, here is the child. Now I have done that which they have asked us to do”. The parents then fall on their knees before the godparents in sign of their gratitude. A kuleb distributes rum and the boiled fowl and bread."
594,"Days of the dead. The festival is known as Finados (“the dead”), or as hanal pixan (“dinner of the souls”). It is a domestic ritual, in which each family recalls and propitiates its own dead; and most families are careful to observe it, for then the dead do not trouble the living. At midnight the people of the house get up and arrange the table, because at midnight the souls of the dead begin to arrive. The table is adorned with the flowers. When the table is ready, the maestro cantor is summoned and friends may be invited. The maestro recites one of the prayers for the dead, and then another table of chocolate and bread is brought in and delivered to the maestro. Then all eat of the food on this and on the other table. Now the dead souls have been given breakfast. Later in the day they are offered dinner. The table for this dinner is spread with a cloth used for the first time: a “zuhuy mantel. ” For the dinner two hens are boiled, and the meat is cut and divided equally among an even number of those small clay vessels known as lac. The fowl must be put in these vessels, and never in jícaras or in modern dishes. Pains are taken that each vessel contains an equal quantity of the same parts of the fowl. To each lac is added a little of the broth and small equal quantities of whatever other food has been prepared—squash, chayote, pork, rice, macaroni. The fowl cooked are always hens, “for roosters would crow and frighten away the souls.” On the table are placed also an even number of jícaras of atole and another filled with water and flowers. This last is the “hand-washing” (x-ppo-kab), the water which the souls of the dead will use, as do the living, to dip their hands in before and after eating. Beside it is placed a new napkin.When all is ready, the maestro cantor comes again, and kneeling on a blanket, prays. This first day is that on which the souls of dead children return: the day of the “angels,” “the great day of the dinner of the child souls” (noh kin u hanal mehen pixanob). So, after he has recited a rosary, the maestro recites the Sube, Sube —the prayer appropriate for child dead—and concludes with an “Our Father.” When he finishes all say, “Good afternoon,” as at a rosario, or novena. Another table is now brought in, with more cooked food; often this is more boiled fowl. This is a secular table; it is provided merely so that everyone will have something to eat; the fowl may be rooster, the cloth is an old one, and china plates may be used. The food on both tables is divided and eaten. The following day is “the great day of the dinner of the big souls” (ninoh k u hanal nucuch pixanob)—the day of the adult dead. The same ritual is followed, except that the prayers recited are those appropriate to adult dead: Señor, Dios Mio; Salve Regina; Oid, Mortales; Perdón, Dios Mio; Adios, Jesús. And the candles, if the ceremony is carefully followed, are black. A week later (the octave) these rituals are repeated, except that the food offered is kol (broth of fowl into which breads are broken). The bread especially appropriate to this day is chachac-uah—bread colored red with arnotto and baked in the earth oven."
595,"The week between the first two days of hanal pixan and the octave of the festival is the time proper for taking from the graves the bones of any relatives who were interred two or three years before. In the shallow soil of the country, this practice is necessary, to make room for new interments. The occasion is one of ceremony, much resembling in its form the rosarios held at the wake. Two fowl are boiled and atole is prepared. In the afternoon two or three men go to the cemetery and take out the bones. When the grave is opened, a little holy water is sprinkled on the bones and they are blessed. The bones are placed on a piece of new cloth and cleaned. Another piece of cloth is put in a small box; the cleansed bones are laid therein and again sanctified with holy water. The box is closed and carried to the little shelter in the cemetery, where a Pater Noster is said over them. Then the box is carried back to the village and into the house and placed on a little stand under a table, on which the food is set out. The maestro cantor recites the prayers used at the wake. The table of food is then offered to the maestro cantor. Another table of food is brought in and served tothose present. At night chocolate is set out, another series of the same prayers recited, and the dead person called by name. The chocolate is served. Holy water is again sprinkled on the box, and that night it is taken to the house in the cemetery and left there. This occasion is one of sadness and mourning. It is not a cheerful occasion, as is the wake, when people often play and laugh. For now the soul is safely out of the world of the living, and the lamentation, that had then to be withheld, may now be given expression."
596,"Then he returns to the bridal party. The boy's parents, inside the house, place seven chairs in a row on one side of the door, and they and the girl's parents sit opposite these in four other chairs. It is usual to invite also the four godparents of the baptism (those of the bride, and those of the groom); and if these are present, they sit next to the parents. The party from the church proceeds to the house in single file, in this order: the bride, the bridegroom, the godmother (sponsor), the godfather, and the three witnesses. The bridegroom walks behind the bride to show “that the man is going to command.” Arrived at the house, the bride kneels in the doorway on a mat prepared for her. Immediately the four parents rise. The bridegroom's father first takes her hand. She inclines her head, and says, “Buenos días, ţata.” She has now called him “father,” for the first time. Then her own father takes her hand and she salutes him similarly, and then her mother, and finally the groom's mother, who says as she takes the bride's hand, “The name of God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost,” and helps the girl to rise. The bride then takes one of the seven empty chairs. Then the bridegroom kneels in the doorway and does as did the bride, but takes the hand of each in the following order: the girl's father, his own father, his own mother, the bride's mother. Then the madrina of the marriage enters; she does not kneel, but takes the hand of each of the same four, in this order: the boy's father, the girl's father, the boy's mother, the girl's mother. Finally the padrino does the same, taking the hand of each in the same order as that followed by the madrina. All now seat themselves. The father of the bridegroom, who is providing the feast and the hospitality on this occasion, summons someone present to act as kuleb. Standing on a table are a bottle of rum, a plate of cigarettes, a glass and a lighted candle. At the direction of the host, the kuleb offers rum and cigarettes to all. Everyone must take a drink and everyone must accept a cigarette; the men light theirs at the candle proffered by the kuleb; the women put theirs in their handkerchiefs to give later to their husbands. The rum and the cigarettes are offered first to the padrino of the wedding, then to the madrina, then to the girl's father, then to the girl's mother, and then to the baptismal godparents. This is the order in which respect is owed to these persons by the bridegroom's father. Then the padrino of the marriage stands up, and one by one he calls upon the father of the bridegroom, the father of the bride, the mother of the bridegroom, and the mother of the bride. As each name is mentioned, its owner stands. The bride and groom then stand. The padrino shakes hands again with each of the four parents, in the same order. He then addresses the four parents. When the padrino has said this, the four parents successively take his hand again and thank him. Then all are seated once more and the boy's father directs the kuleb to deliver to the sponsors of the marriage a table on which are placed a bottle of rum and a plate of cigarettes. The padrino accepts this, and directs the kuleb to distribute the rum and cigarettes. When the rum has been entirely consumed, the kuleb lays the bottle on its side to indicate this fact, and similarly indicates the consuming of the cigarettes by turning the plate upside down. Thereupon, again at the direction of the bridegroom's father, the kuleb offers and then distributes half a bottle of rum and a smaller quantity of cigarettes. This is known as ppobom- mesa, “to clean the table.”"
597,"Catholic Wedding ceremony. Not much emphasis put on the ceremony. The parents of the boy and those of the girl do not go to the church. The couple are accompanied only by the two sponsors of the marriage and three witnesses. When the ceremony in the church is over, one of the witnesses goes ahead to tell those waiting in the boy's house that the bridal party is coming."
598,"Preliminary Day 3. Wednesday, July 1 At least some people encamped: Preparation of the grounds. Tobacco smoking for the dead. Upon their first meeting at the busk grounds two friends shake hands. Then each lights the other's smoke, and they “puff away.” Then they bow to each other, after which they will take turns reciting the virtues and faults of the deceased: “He was a good man; he drank too mich; but he was strong…,” etc., each saying “yes, yes,” as the other took his turn in the recitation"

609,"Prayer Meeting. Occurs each week. Prayers and songs are chanted intermittently throughout the ritual. At one point prayers are spoken aloud simultaneously and independently. Devotional reading is given and sermon presented. Sermons at the prayer meeting can be critical, they tend to focus on parochial issues, individuals are often named as examples, and behavior is criticized. If any member of the congregation wishes to rededicate then there is a sub-ritual which sometimes occurs at this point, however it does not occur at every prayer meeting (see below for details), in short it involves an individual sitting in a special seat and shaking hands with the congregation. Monetary offerings are given and final announcements are made."
610,"Following the message, the speaker extends an “invitation,” or in Mvskoke, obhoyketv (“to call”), for anyone “who doesn't know Christ, and wants to rededicate, their lives, be baptized or become a church member” to come forward and make that desire public. In the center of the sanctuary is a bench that is normally oriented along an east-west line. This bench is called the ohliketv merkv (“mercy seat”). The pastor approaches the seated person and asks for a “statement” regarding the purpose of his or her coming forward. Stated reasons are most often prayer requests or rededication. After the pastor has heard the statement, he announces it to the congregation. The deacon is then called on to ask the person questions of clarification or challenge. After the questions are suitably answered, the pastor calls on the congregation to “give witness to the rededication by raising your right hand.” This is not viewed as a vote but rather as an acknowledgment of the person's statement and a witness to the stated intent. At this point the deacon leads a song, and all members rise. The pastor shakes the seated person's hand again, then steps aside. The ministers approach the mercy seat and shake the hand of the seated individual. The deacon then ushers all of the male members out of their pews, one row at a time, and up to shake the hand of the seated person. The men are followed by the women's leaders and lastly by the women members and guests. Many of the people have words of encouragement (e.g., “God bless you” or “I'll pray for you”), which they whisper to the person as they shake his or her hand. When all have shaken the seated person's hand, the person is escorted by the deacon to shake the hands of everyone unable to stand. When all have been greeted, the person is restored to his or her place, the mercy seat is turned back, and the service continues, usually with an additional speaker presenting a message, followed by another invitation sequence as described above. Following the last invitation, an additional song is sung and an offering is taken. A deacon turns the mercy seat, and a handwoven offering basket is placed on the center of the bench. A song is sung, led by anyone."
611,"Fourth Sunday Meetings, obligate members of the larger community to interact regularly with each other. Attendance at any given Fourth Sunday Meeting consists of a majority of visitors. Thus the Fourth Sunday Meeting structure ensures regular and wide interaction among church members in the Seminole community. Three weeks out of each month, members are obligated to interact with other social units. The meeting ambiance is more celebrative and sermons are less critical at Fourth Sunday Meetings than at Prayer Meetings, but the action remains the same."
612,"The Fasting service, Friday before Sunday when bread and wine are consumed. The first bell for the Fasting service is rung at 8:30 A.M. Members begin arriving at about that same time. The male members gather in a camp house, and the female members gather in the sanctuary. As the members gather, they join in informal social and interpersonal conversation. After the second bell (rung at about 9:00 A.M. by a women's leader), the women, who are in the church building, begin a service consisting of songs and prayers and “words of encouragement.” The men, seated in the main room of the camp house, gather for songs, words of encouragement, and exhortation. During this very informal gathering, the men are often involved in personal grooming (e.g., paring their fingernails, pulling out their facial hairs with a small broad spring, and combing their hair). After about an hour and a half, a women's leader rings the bell for a third time and thus signals the men to join the women in the sanctuary. The men enter as the women are singing a song. A prayer, led by the women's leader, follows the song. When the prayer is concluded, the women's leader formally hands over leadership of the service to the pastor. He continues by leading a song and a prayer, followed by a short devotional reading. The format of this service is distinctive in that the pastor gives short devotional readings after each song and prayer. During this gathering, each male member is expected to lead a song and a prayer. The service is considered incomplete, or unfulfilled, if every male member present does not vtotkv esfaceces, or lead a song and a prayer. The service is fulfilled after this is accomplished. Occasionally a male member will have to leave the service before it is concluded, but he will leave only after he has first led a song and a prayer. Having thus fulfilled his work, he is free to go. In this way, local congregational unity is affirmed before the upcoming, public Big Meeting."
613,"Communion service. The ringing of the bell calls members to the Communion service. Members are seated together in the front two pews. The ambiance of this service is markedly different from that of the previous services of the day. Participants enter in silence and anticipation. A pastor explained the sacred quality of the Communion service: “Because God blesses it, it is very, very acake (“sacred”)”.While the congregation watches in silence, the deacons prepare the Communion table. The table, normally in front of the pulpit, is brought into the center of the sanctuary. Two deacons carefully place a white lace tablecloth over the Communion table. The bread is placed on a paten, and a chalice is filled with wine from a new bottle. The deacons reverently cover the elements. After the table is prepared, the deacons are seated and the pastor leads a song and a prayer. Several other songs and prayers are led by the deacons and floor members. The praying is more urgent during the Communion service—many tears are shed as supplications are voiced. The pastor's devotional reading is from one of the New Testament accounts of Communion. His commentary focuses on the solemnity of Communion and the imperative to fulfill this work. The pastor concludes his devotional with an impassioned prayer asking that the congregation be made worthy of the sacrament. The head deacon breaks the bread into bite-sized pieces, then approaches the pastor with the paten. The pastor takes a piece of bread and eats it. The deacon makes his way to all of the ministers seated up front, offering them each the paten. After the ministers have eaten the bread, the deacon works his way around the men's side, then to the women's leaders, and then to the rest of the women. The deacons are the last to take the bread. When they have eaten it, the paten with the remaining bread is placed back on the table and is covered. Additional songs and prayers follow. While a prayer song is being sung, the chalice is uncovered by the deacons, and it too is offered to the pastor, the ministers, the male floor members, the women's leaders, and the female floor members, who drink from it and then hand it back to the deacons. The deacons are the last to consume the wine. They return the chalice to the table and cover it. While the deacons are covering the elements, the floor members move the pews back against the north and south walls. They do this to provide a large open area around the Communion table. In this space, all of those in attendance form a single-file circle around the Communion table. The men are on the southern side, the women on the northern; the pastor and ministers are on the west, the listeners on the east. One or more songs are sung. During this portion of the service, the theme of unity is acted out. The pastor enters the edge of the circle and faces the minister who was standing immediately to his right. The pastor shakes his hand, pulls him close, and quietly speaks to him some words of encouragement. The pastor continues in a counterclockwise direction, shaking the hand of each individual within the circle and speaking personal words of encouragement to each one. After the pastor has addressed three or four individuals in this manner, the minister who had been standing next to the pastor enters the edge of the circle and faces the person who was standing immediately to his right, shakes his hand, and speaks words of personal encouragement in the same manner that the pastor had done. After the minister has addressed three or four individuals, the person who had been standing next to the minister enters the edge of the circle and continues the pattern. Eventually all participants enter the circle to shake the hand of, and speak words of encouragement to, every other person in the circle. After a person has made the round, he or she returns to his or her original position in the circle, to be addressed by those still making the round. Each person, therefore, has an active role in addressing others and also a passive role in receiving the address of others. This portion of the service is extremely emotional and moving. Some of the interactions are quite lengthy and personal. Many tears are shed, and there is a feeling of solidarity among the participants. It is not unusual for this portion of the service to last for more than an hour. The service concludes with the usual handshakes and members saying to the visitors, “Mvto, ralalvkvs! ” (“Thank you, come again!”). Informal conversation takes place while the refreshments are being prepared. At the same time, the pews are returned to their usual places."
614,"The Little Festival or the festival celebrating the breaking of the fast, occurs on the day succeeding the great fast at Ramadān. The Great Festival or the Sacrificial Feast, takes place seventy days after the Little Festival on the day the pilgrims descend from the mount of □Arafa in Saudi Arabia to offer their animal sacrifices to Allāh at Mina, fulfilling the final ritual of the pilgrimage. During the early morning hours of the festival, a pious man, whom the villagers respectfully call “al-shaykh ”, mounts the roof of the village mosque, and chants thanks to Allāh on this occasion. Later on, he is joined by some boys who gather around him to repeat after him the same chant. This serves as a reminder to the villagers that the day has been officially proclaimed a religious holiday. All villagers put their work aside for the day, don their best clothes. The women prepare special food and sweets for the □īd and carry some to the tombs of their dead relatives in commemoration. Around nine o'clock, a short □īd prayer is offered by some of the men in the mosque. At the end of the prayer the imām (prayer leader) offers an appropriate sermon. In the sermon pertaining to al-□īd al-□aghīr, the imām congratulated all those who have just completed the fast at Rama□ān. He reminded them that they should have given away their zakāt. He informed them what awaits the faithful in the hereafter, and what punishment awaits the sinner. He went on to declare that the □īd was not for those who had been able to buy new garments for themselves, but for those who had been able, due to their good works, to earn the true blessings of God. In the sermon pertaining to □īd al-A□a, the imām reminded the faithful that this was the day on which the pilgrimage to Mecca ended. He suggested that all in the audience should make the journey some time in the future. He went on to explain the nature and the function of animal sacrifices on that day. Once the sermon is completed, the men shake hands with one another and exchange greetings by saying “kul □ām wa-antum bi-khayr ”, or “may each and every coming year find you enjoying the best [of life]”. The response to this greeting is “the same to you”. The men then form lines across the road leading to the village cemetery and take up a chant as they proceed to the burial ground. Upon their arrival at the cemetery, they read the Fāti□a (the first chapter in the Qur'ān ) collectively and offer a blessing to all those buried at the spot and to “the souls of all dead Muslims”. Then, each person moves to the graves of his ancestors and friends. He reaches into the container of food placed on the grave and takes a bite. He then recites the Fāti□a and offers it on behalf of the occupant of the grave. The rest of the food is given away to the poor or to others who visit the grave. It is believed that the food given on such a day earns the dead person □asanāt that will help to lighten his burden for the sayi'āt he acquired during his lifetime. Once a food container becomes empty, it is quickly removed from the grave. The tradition among the villagers is that if any angel visits the area on such a day and discovers an empty container, the dead person on whose grave it was found suffers a curse. Following the visit to the cemetery, the men return to their homes to exchange the □īd greetings with their families. Wives and children greet their husbands and parents by wishing them well and by kissing their hands. Members of the upper class stay at home to receive visitors. After such visits they drop in at the homes of their neighbors to extend greetings. They then proceed to bring gifts to their married female relatives, such as daughters, granddaughters and cousins. Completing their visits, they return home to enjoy a hearty meal."

617,"All saiyârât leave Jerusalem for Nebî Mûsâ with great pomp and monotonous music; the procession is headed by the banner. As soon as they pass Gethsemane they furl the banner and march slowly and quietly. As soon as they are in sight of the shrine of the Prophet they rearrange their group, unfurl the banner and begin the formal procession again. First they raise small heaps of stones as q anâ□ir and recite the fâti□ah. The dervish who heads the procession sends one of his followers to announce their coming to the other dervishes who are already in Nebî Mûsâ. This messenger is called nadjdjâb. His master binds a mandîl around his neck to be untied only by the šê□ who welcomes him at the sanctuary. This nadjdjâb runs directly to the maqâm, all the time beating his naqqârah (a sort of a small drum). As soon as he reaches the building all the dervishes, to whatever □arîqah they may belong, go out to welcome him, and the oldest dervish unties the mandîl from his neck, reciting the fâti□ah at the same time. This šé□ orders all saiyârât and □idad to welcome the new-comers. First the mazâr of er-Râ□î is visited and then the crowd proceeds to the Nebî. As soon as the outer court is reached, the procession advances very slowly, while their enthusiasm increases. All the way to er-Râ□î and to the Nebî gun shots are fired in order to increase the enthusiasm and to proclaim their coming. This custom is no longer allowed. Processions are generally arranged in the following way: The banner-bearer goes ahead, followed by the musicians. Then follow some young men of the party, encircling their leader and dancing according to the tempo given by him. Every dance is accompanied by singing. The leader recites a strophe and the others repeat it. He swings a sword, a stick or a handkerchief in the air and dances with them, thus giving the tempo. Sometimes all or part of the musicians are seen in the circle. While singing and dancing the party clap their hands in a rhythmical way. This clapping of the hands may be met with in all seasons of great mirth and rejoicing and both performers and audience never seem to weary of this simple, but universal amusement. They proceed slowly until they reach the maqâm. Some of the women spectators welcome the party with zaghârît, or short songs ending with a shrill tongue-rattling."
618,
619,"Dances are never scheduled, but are spontaneously initiated. They may take place as often as several times a week, but the average is once in ten days. Though they sometimes begin in response to a specific, pressing illness or shared anxiety, they most often start in fun. Then they may proceed to become serious, as various people go into trance and begin to cure. Or they may remain on a level of fun for many, many hours, and no-one may go into trance at all. Dances usually last most or all of a night. During this time there may be numerous fluctuations of mood. The dancing may be lack-lustre or ardent, and there may be several periods of intense curing interspersed with periods during which no-one is in trance. Just at dawn there is invariably a great surge of energy, and the curing medicine is believed then to be very strong. About half the adult men achieve trance at some time during their lifetimes. Some practise it for years and become accomplished curers. It is believed that when in trance these curers possess the power to draw out illness from the bodies of sick people. The illness is then cast away so that it may no longer harm anyone. Sickness is believed among the !Kung and others to be caused by tiny, invisible arrows brought from God by the spirits of the dead. When a curer is in trance he goes to the sick person and lays fluttering hands on him to draw out these arrows into his own body. The curer works himself to an apex of excitement, at which point his entire body gives a violent shrug directed toward expelling the arrows through his upper back. At the same moment he utters a characteristic curing shriek. In none of this is it believed that supernatural beings enter or speak through the bodies of the curers. The shamans themselves are active, it is believed, moving about earth and sky to benefit the group. But the curers, important as they are, readily acknowledge their absolute dependence upon the singers. The central ritual event in traditional !Kung life is the medicinal trance dance, in which all members of a band participate. Healers enter trance and ritually draw illness out of a sick person's body. Other group members support their efforts with singing, clapping, and dancing. The dance takes place anywhere from a few times a month to several times a week and is grounded in a very old tradition—so old that its origins are beyond speculation, even among the oldest living !Kung. Its long history is confirmed by scenes depicted in rock paintings, by dance circles etched in rock, by archaeological findings, and by the occurrence of dances similar in form, content, and musical style in San groups that speak languages other than !Kung and live several hundred miles away. When the curing has been going on for some time, they begin to reach a state of patterned frenzy. They no longer go around to the people, their spasms of grunting and shrieking become more frequent and violent, their stomachs heave, they stagger and sway. They rush to the fire, trample it, pick up the coals, set fire to their hair. They believe that fire activates the medicine in them. People hold them to keep them from falling and beat out the flames. The medicine men rush out into the darkness, where //Gauwa and the //gauwasi are lurking. They hurl burning sticks and swear at them. “Filthy face!” they screech. “Take away the sickness you have brought. You are bad. You want to kill us. Go away…. Hishe, you are a liar. This man will not die.” At this point the medicine man may fall down in deep trance and appear to be unconscious or semiconscious, with eyes closed, stiff as a board, unable to walk. This stage of trance may last only a brief time or may continue for hours—even into the next day. Gradually it is resolved and the medicine man takes up his normal activities."
620,"Debe was a 30-year-old Dobe man, married with two children. On January 14, 1969, he shot and killed a juvenile male kudu. The following day he shot and killed an adult female kudu and he asked his relative, ≠Dau, to perform the first buck ceremony for the female. He had previously received the cuts for killing a male, so this, the second of the two ceremonies, was supposed to “finish” him. On the morning of January 16, while most of the women were out of camp, about 15 men and boys gathered in the center of the Dobe camp to perform the ceremony and to cook some of the kudu meat, including the special portions reserved exclusively for the older men. On the shade side of the cooking fire sit the older men who can eat the special male portions, and on the sun side sit Debe and his agemates and the cutter. Among the older men the atmosphere is casual, with many side conversations going on. Among the novices there is a more serious air, with Debe looking the gravest. ≠Dau takes a razor blade (a trade item) and, lifting up a pinch of skin at the top of Debe's breastbone, makes a series of 10 short, vertical, parallel cuts through the pinch. The blood wells out of the cuts and combines to flow down Debe's chest. 1. Now the medicine, a mixture of !gwa (“a charred medicinal herb”) and fat from Debe's kill is rubbed into the cuts. When the cuts heal a neat row of blue tattoos will remain. 2. The next cuts, made in the same manner, are on the left side of the chest over the heart. The !gwa ash and kudu fat mixture is again rubbed into the wounds, as it is in all subsequent cuttings. 3. Two more series of cuts are made on the left side of the stomach, 5 cm above the hip bone. 4. Two series of cuts are made on the back under the left scapula. 5. Cuts are made at five locations on the left arm: upper biceps, lower biceps, upper forearm, lower forearm, wrist. 6. The final cuts are made above the bridge of the nose on the brow in the midline. Dau explains the cuts: “I cut his chest and put in medicine to lift up his heart and make him want to seek meat; I put [it] in his arm and wrist to make his arm soft [swa ] and his aim correct; in his back to make sure that the game won't run away; in his brow so that he may see things quickly.” After the cuts, five more rituals are performed. ≠Dau rubs Debe's bow with blood from the kill. He loudly cracks Debe's knuckles on both hands: “We say if there is no thumb crack, then you don't have an animal coming up. But if it cracks it means you are going out tomorrow and kill something.” He rubs melted fat on the forearm and biceps and massages (n //abu ) it firmly “to make the arm soft to make hunting better.” He pinches up a vein on the lower part of Debe's bicep with a thumb and forefinger and then pushes the vein down with his elbow “so that when you shoot, you shoot one arrow and the animal drops.” He rubs the severed ears of the kudu on Debe's head: “This is to make the animals come closer to us so we don't have far to shoot. We want the game to flap-flap its ears so we can walk right up to it and kill it. We don't want ears raised and alert!” And ≠Dau pantomimes the kudu's behavior using the ears as props. After Debe is done other young men ask to have some cuts done as well. Bo, a younger initiated man, takes over from ≠Dau and under his guidance administers two small series of cuts (chest and brow) to Tsaa and one to /Gau (chest only). After these two are done, ≠Toma, a younger brother of Debe, in his midteens who hasn't killed anything big yet, steps into the circle almost in fun and the senior cutter, ≠Dau, massages his arms. Now the men eat the meat; those over 35 years old eat the “men's portions” cooked in a separate pot, and the younger men including the initiate Debe, eat other portions. The right to eat the men's portions is according to age, not hunting accomplishment, and even though Debe has killed both a male and a female animal he will have to wait 5 years more before he can partake of it. The men's portion consists of the shoulders (≠tore ), the belly, and several parts of the intestines. These parts are reserved for older men in all animals killed, not just those used in a first buck ceremony."
621,"During the process of divination two images, ovitakas, representing male and female, are set up before the ocimbanda, that he may cause them to be inhabited by spirits. These are not worshipped as idols, yet are venerated in a sense by the common people, especially by women and children. The images are carved out of hard wood, and stand a little over a foot in height. Each one is partially clothed in a cotton wrapper, and bears about the neck several strands of native beads. They possess unusual interest, as on the back of the head of each the manner of wearing the hair of each sex is carefully portrayed. Attached to the male by a string around the neck is a rosette of dull red and yellow feathers, one of which has been artificially notched. To enable the ocimbanda to call the spirits into these images, he uses a whistle, ombinga, consisting of the horn of a small antelope inserted into an ox-tail wrapped with beads arranged into broad bands of white, black, and red. Furthermore, when about to divine, the doctor eats a number of ants. He also has some medicines known collectively as ovihemba, which are kept in a skin, from which he takes and eats before and during divining. Of rattles, ocisikilo, shaken by the ocimbanda during the practice of his art, there are two, both bottle-shaped gourds containing cannalilly seeds. skins one upon the other, and upon these he places his basket of charms. He puts white and red clay on his eyebrows, cheek bones, shoulders, and elbows; also stripes his body with these clays, and puts on his necklace and headdress, which gives him a strange, wild appearance. Taking one of the gourd rattles, and giving the others to the parties interested, setting up the images, he is ready for operations. He begins by shaking the gourds and blowing the horn whistle, at the same time chanting in a minor strain, all the rest responding in chorus. In this way he works himself up into a sort of frenzy. He then takes the basket of charms, and, by throwing them slightly, claims to be able to read from them the past and future, and to declare the guilt or innocence of a person. In this way trivial matters, as well as the most weighty, even life and death, are decided. For instance, if, while determining whether an accused person is a witch or not, in his shaking and throwing of the charms the little horn with the wax and red seeds should stand upright, that would be taken as evidence of guilt; while if, on the contrary, the little image with the small cowry shell on the head should stand upright, that is evidence conclusive that the person is innocent. Not only is the question of guilt thus decided, but witch-doctors are thought to be able to predict coming events"
622,"Curing Ritual. A screen of posts and boughs was erected, and on one side of this two male drummers stood, each with a long tubular drum before him. On the other side of the fence were three wooden posts, each two feet high, circular in cross section, and painted, as indicated in the illustration. Near the posts was a basket, so closely woven that it contained water in which green twigs and leaves were soaking. The drums began to beat and a group of women clapped hands in rhythm. The patient knelt before the small painted wooden posts close to the basket of water, into which she dipped her face from time to time. While the drum music and hand-clapping continued, the medicine-man took wet twigs from the basket. He drew these very slowly along the spine of the patient from neck to sacrum, as if painting with a brush. The patient occasionally shivered from head to foot; then remained still, except for the dipping of her face in the water, until the next paroxysm shook her. This routine continued for ten minutes. The medicine-man then knelt by the woman, dug a small hole in the ground, and pulled up one of the painted wooden posts which he placed in the patient's hands. The medicine-man kept his hands over those of the patient while she transferred the painted post to the new hole that he had prepared. Finally the basket containing the water and leaves was buried thirty feet from the scene of operations."
623,"Rain-Making ritual, The rain-maker (upuli ) is a medicine-man who has specialized in this function. The upuli, who was an Ocivokue of Ngongo, and not an Ocimbundu, was dressed in only a skirt of cloth, and his equipment consisted of a reed whistle and a hair switch made from a cow's tail. The dance was a slow revolution without any violent leaping. The man held his arms upward, fully extended, and went through the motions of drawing rain from above; then he made slow arm movements suggestive of spreading the rain all around. At times he stood quite still and gave a shrill whistle. The hair switch was constantly twirled and flourished."
624,"New fire is made during epidemic sickness, at the accession of a king, and at the building of a new village. On such occasions the twirling method is employed. The fire made is called ondalu, which is the ordinary word for fire. When an epidemic of sickness occurs the chief of the village takes a present of eight yards of cloth to the medicine-man and asks the cause of the visitation. The medicine-man replies, “Your fire is dirty and worn out, you must have new fire.” The village chief takes this news to the people, saying, “Tomorrow we must find a goat, a chicken, and a pig, so that we may kill them. Then we must make a new fire.” The chief pays for these animals. Next day the medicine-man starts a fire by the twirling method and as soon as the fire has been kindled he kills a fowl whose blood is allowed to drop on the fire and the wood near-by. The sacrificial goat and pig are treated in the same way. Sometimes a boy who is learning to be a medicine-man kills these animals. Meat from each of the animals so sacrificed is cooked on this newly made fire, card being taken that each kind of meat is kept in a separate pot. There is no special pottery for this cooking. When the meat is cooked it is tasted by a girl from twelve to fourteen years of age who hands a portion to the chief, who distributes the meat among the village elders (olosekulu ). The meat from the chicken, which must be fat is the first to be distributed. A cock or a hen may be chosen, but if the latter is selected it must be utenda; that is to say, it must not have arrived at the egg-laying age. Finally there is a distribution of meat among the villagers who have been present throughout the ceremony. The chief speaks saying, “We wish good fortune to the new fire.” Each person has to take the responsibility for quenching his own fire before the new one is ceremonially made. After the feast each father of a “restricted” family takes away a portion of the newly kindled fire."
625,"Osaka is a ritual game played only by men, and only when a village headman or a king is dying. The ball (ombunje) is made by sewing lizard skin over a hard spherical fruit about six centimeters in diameter. A man continues to dance with this little ball clenched in his outstretched hand, while another dancer hits the muscles of his arm to make him release the ball. This game is thought to give strength to the sick man. There is a transfer of the endurance of the dancers to the invalid."
626,"The most important religious ceremony (rŭm-fat ) takes place once a year after the harvest. The bo˙n-t'i˙n makes an offering to all the divinities with whom he has contact. The villagers bring rice, millet, eggs, butter, and fruit of all kinds, which are placed on a stone on a hilltop well in view of ko˙n-čen ču (Kanchenjunga), the mountain that dominates the whole region. The bo˙n-t'i˙n invokes successively the different summits of the mountain, which are identified with the following divinities: ko˙n-čen-ču and his wife ko˙n-lo-ču, pŭn-dim and pŭn-zo˙n-ču, their son and daughter, ra-tat and ra-yot, their grandson and granddaughter, ši˙n-mu and ko-lun-mu-ču, their male and female servants. The offspring and the servants are the lesser summits on either side of ko˙n-čen-ču. Next the bo˙n-t'i˙n addresses the spirits of the earth and the protectors of the village, tsen-gog a mountain divinity, ta-lya˙n-do, divinity of the heights above the village, so-mo˙n-po˙n-di, spirit of the hamlet of Somalbong. To these divinities, whose role seems obscure, he offers rice, millet, and oranges. Thirdly the bo˙n-t'i˙n requests the chief of the demons to restrain his followers. Of these tam-nok-mu˙n and his partner lya˙n-šer were mentioned as the most powerful. These two black demons come from the plains; having no children they are particularly self-willed and so more difficult to control than the others, who are named tsen-dŭt with his mate tŭn-ku˙n-mit and lu˙n-ji with his mate lu˙n-lu˙n-mu˙n, dwellers in caves, rocks, and streams. The mu˙n receive offerings of či (millet beer) and rice."
627,"A serious illness often necessitates the sacrifice of an ox. Before killing the animal invocations are made to the demons gie-bu-mu˙n, čo-gye-mu˙n, tsen-dŭt, and me-so-mu˙n, who takes the life of men. While the animal is being killed, the sick man is attached to it by a cord, and the bo˙n-t'i˙n beseeches the demon to accept the flesh and blood of the animal in place of the life of the man. The animal is cut up and the parts arranged ceremonially upon a bamboo mat. Six special offerings consisting of pieces of neck and lung, some rice and millet beer, are placed on bamboo leaves. The bo˙n-t'i˙n begs the demons to accept them, praying that they may cease to cause illness of all kinds: head-ache, stomach-ache, pains in the limbs, etc."
628,"Festival in honour of Kinchinjunga. Banging of drums and cymbals and trumpet-blowing at intervals throughout the night, but no set piece, so to speak, before 4.30 a.m., when there was a blast of trumpets such as that which we are asked to believe brought down the walls of Jericho. I was half asleep at the time and thought for a moment that an earthquake was imminent. Soon after dawn more Lamas arrived, and by about eight the usual twenty or so were present. Before the service started a large bundle of wormwood was lighted in the garden, the moment when it took fire being greeted by loud shouts from all present. The purpose of this fire is to keep the clouds away from Kinchinjunga throughout the day, so that the god may observe the ceremonies being carried out in its honour. All day yesterday Chodu and two companions spent the day constructing a most elaborate torma called Pong Rum. It was built up on a wooden baseboard about eighteen inches long and contained five separate offerings, the central one, dedicated to Jung Ngaw, being rather larger than the others, which were in honour of the following deities, all said to be satellites of Konchen: Pauhunri (a mountain forming part of the Cho La range, and known to irreverent mountaineers as Poor Henry. It is very prominent from Lingtem); Pe matchin Chaw-men; Ditchen Phoop; and Hla-ri Ning-phoop. The intervening spaces between these five main cones were completely filled with small tormas of every shape, said to represent attendants, ministers, servants and various minor deities. There were over two hundred of these, each having. a separate name. It was found that the entire company could not be accommodated on the Pong Rum itself, so the overflow was arranged on a brass tray, which the Lamas, however, later forgot about and never put on the altar. In the centre of the Pong Rum and immediately in front of the central cone was a yak's head (Yok thyak ) made of dough, but nobody seemed to know its significance. The preparation of the entire offering took four men roughly five hours. At the end of the ceremony it will be broken up and eaten; but the men who have made it are not allowed to taste it, which seems unjust. This morning the whole thing was brought out of the monastery and each of the five main cones further embellished by the addition of a sort of tin cape on which a design was built up in butter coloured bright red, blue, yellow and green. The whole thing now looks like the sweets served on Lloyd-Triestino liners and is, I should imagine, equally unpalatable. It was now taken inside and placed on a table in front of the altar, immediately in front of the central figure of Guru Rimpoche. Later on, bowls of water and several lighted lamps were put down in front of it, and a jar of incense was lighted at one side. There was the usual periodic chanting, like bees swarming, alternating with the usual bursts of music. About midday a small table was brought out and placed on the grass in front of the monastery. A bowl of sher-kem, the special ceremonial chi with maize and other grain floating in it, was placed on this, together with a large brass tray containing a number of small tormas. A young novice now came and stood by the table, took up one of the tormas in a spoon, and dipped it in the mixture. Having done this he held the spoon out at arm's length until there was what I can only describe as a musical orgasm inside the building, when he threw it from him with a shout of loch! whereupon it was at once snapped up by one of the numerous dogs waiting on the edge of the grass for this purpose. This was repeated at short intervals for about an hour, when one of the Lamas decided that it had gone on long enough and threw the remains of the liquid and the tormas away without further ceremony. At about six in the evening, just when it was growing dark, the whole Pong Rum was carefully removed from its place in front of the altar. It was first exhibited to the assembled Lamas inside the building and was then carried in procession once round the monastery. Except for the two men carrying it, the Lamas remained inside the building, but most of the spectators walked behind the offering, some of them turning prayer-wheels and chanting as they went. One man seemed almost fervent (or was it merely the drink?) and called upon the mountain god to bless him; and several told the carriers to halt a moment at the corner so that the gods could see the offering; but by this time Kinchinjunga was completely obscured by clouds. It is believed that the spirits take their departure while the Pong Rum is being carried round the building. As soon as the procession reached the main door again the offering was put down on the ground unceremoniously and quickly torn to pieces and distributed to all present. Some people first put their portion to their foreheads in an attitude of reverence before stuffing it into their bosoms to take home; others treated the host with no reverence and consumed it straight away."
629,"Lamas, but also by youths of the upper classes, mostly the sons of the various State officials. It is not so much a dance as a display of agility, discipline, and energy, in which considerable powers of endurance are required. It aims at combining physical training with a feeling of religious zeal and exaltation; and for this reason all the dancers are required to remain celibate during the month or so in which they train and prepare for the ceremony. They are also expected not to drink during this period of preparation; but during the actual performance, which lasts for some six hours or so, they are kept going by frequent draughts of alcohol. The ceremony is rendered impressive and dignified by the religious rite which is being carried on inside the monastery during the whole time the dance is being performed outside. This dance differs from all others of the sort I have seen in that the performers, except for the figures of Kinchinjunga and Maha Kala, are not masked. It consists of an almost continuous slow circling round and round, with a great deal of sword-brandishing; more like the sort of thing one sees at a military tournament, except that the performers are all dressed in elaborate costumes of Chinese silks of various bright and highly contrasting colours. The warriors formed up in two long lines as each of the two gods made its first entry from behind the dark brown curtains which covered the front of the monastery, after which the slow circling was again resumed. Both Kinchinjunga and Maha Kala did a rather dull pas seul, which went on much too long; it, too, consisted of the same slow circling, without any variation in the step. After a time each god gradually danced nearer and nearer the monastery entrance and finally disappeared within. The whole performance appeared to be without either beginning or end, and there seemed to be no reason why it should have ever finished. It was an attractive spectacle for the first twenty minutes or so, perhaps because of the brightly-coloured dresses, after which it quickly became intensely boring owing to the entire lack of variety. The music was provided by drums, cymbals, and clarionets and consisted of the O mani peme hum tune which we got to know so well in Lingtem, with the addition of indiscriminate undertones played on the long ten-foot monastery trumpets. I think the tune is more pleasing, however, when sung unaccompanied, as it always was by the Inebus in Lingtem. The dance ended with the circumambulation of the monastery by all the performers, including the two horses which are dedicated to the service of Kinchinjunga and Maha Kala, and never ridden from the day they are born. They were plumed and draped in thick Chinese brocades and looked most impressive; but considerable efforts on the part of their grooms were necessary before they could be persuaded to take their part in the formal procession."
630,"On the day previous to the ceremony he makes a large figure of a toad out of dough, buries it deep in the ground and lights a fire above it. He meditates inside the monastery but returns to the spot where he has buried the image in order to utter spells from time to time."
631,"On a za da o (Monday) between the first and the fifteenth day of 'ayit or ít (October-November) the people collect in the altar room of one of the houses. First they select a special place in the room, well away from the ordinary house altar, and dedicate it to p˘a dím rŭm, they clean that part of the floor, and cover it with banana leaves. They then decorate the special place with many flowers, and put a plate with a wild bird, a fish, rice and a bottle of cí on the leaves. Then they kneel down and prostrate themselves before this place, and a man officiating as the leader of the ceremony recites the following prayer to p˘a dím rŭm on behalf of the entire village. Having finished this prayer the leader turns to the people gathered and spits on them, thereby averting diseases and epidemics. Thereafter they eat, drink, and enjoy themselves for the remainder of the day and the following night, and next morning they return to their houses. The following year the same ceremony will be performed in another house, and in this way the ceremony will in the course of time be held in all the houses of the village"
632,"The mŭn Purifies the Place, On the day fixed the mŭn is invited to the place, where she performs a purifying ceremony for the protection of the house against the evil powers. For this purpose she is provided with some milk and butter, and invokes the gods to bless the building. She invokes her own tutelary deity asking for protection for the builder. She burns the butter and throws some drops of the milk into the air for the gods, and finally she pours the remaining milk on the four lines along which the walls of the house are going to be erected. Thereafter the building can begin."
633,"The Carpenter's Prayer, According to his ability the builder provides a bull or a goat as a sacrificial animal. The carpenter kills the animal, and offers blood to the mung, the dŭt, and the cen in order to prevent them from obstructing the erection of the house. On this occasion the carpenter recites a prayer. The lumps of meat and the drops of cí are thrown into the air in various directions as gifts to the mung, dŭt and cen. this ceremony is performed in honour of tsán dóng rŭm, the god of the house. The carpenter performs the ceremony to this rŭm both before the erection of the house, and when the building is finished. This rŭm sits on lí dóng kŭng, the cross of the house, and if this beam is ever destroyed, the ceremony must be repeated before a new one is put up."
634,"The Carpenter's Ceremony for Protection of the House, when the house has been erected, the carpenter performs a ceremony to his tutelary deity called mung gum rŭm or mung kung rŭm. He uses a hen, a green leaf, a Rupee, some paddy rice, some beaten rice, a fish and a bird. The green leaf is put on the small, low table called shing te kŭp (see p. 66), and all the other offerings are placed on the leaf. Then he offers the following petition to his tutelary deity. Afterwards the gifts offered are distributed to the children."
635,"Annual Sacrifice of Bull to lí rŭm. The house has its own god, called lí rŭm, who stays in the house and protects it and the members of the family. In the month ít, shortly after the Lepcha New Year, a ceremony is performed to lí rŭm. The head of the family selects a castrated bull, and the bong thíng or the mŭn is sent for. Inside the house the officiant arranges an altar of two small bamboo tables, placed close to the wall, one in front of the other. The officiant puts a heap of rice in the middle of the table close to the wall, and places an earthenware vessel, filled with oil and used as an oil lamp, on top of the rice. Three bamboo bottles with cí are placed on the second table. If the officiant is the bong thíng, he will keep his hat in his right hand while sitting cross-legged in front of the second table. When it is the mŭn, who officiates, she will loosen her hair and let it hang down her back, but she will not untie her plaits; and she will keep her particular headgear on her right shoulder. Then she will kneel down in front of the second table, and leaning forwards, she will say her prayers. The officiant prays to lí rŭm on behalf of the members of the family, expressing their gratitude because lí rŭm during the past year has protected the house and its inmates, and he/she states that the sacrifice of the bullock implies a request for protection in the year to come. Then the officiant asks a male member of the family to kill the bullock; its eyes are covered with leaves, and a man knocks it down by hitting it with an axe on the neck. Then they skin the dead animal, cut open the body, and disembowel it. Next they place a mat before altar no. 2 and place the legs of the bullock and some pieces of the meat on it, with the head of the bullock on top, facing the altar. The organs are kept outside the house. The officiant requests lí rŭm to accept the sacrifice, to protect the house, and to bestow happiness on its members; and he/she finishes his/her invocation by promising lí rŭm another bullock next year. Then the officiant touches the bamboo bottles with the middle finger, sprinkles drops of cí on the heap of rice, lightly touches the meat and requests lí rŭm to consume it. Finally the members of the family take away the meat, fry it and eat it."
636,"Initial Ceremony to mung. A sacrifice is performed at Tingbung during the summer season before the tilling of the fields for millet and maize. The sacrifice is performed early in the morning in any place where there is said to be a mung. Any domestic animal may be used for this purpose. A mŭn selects the sacrificial animal, and the whole village proceeds to the sacrificial place where they kill the animal by cutting its throat or by thrusting a pointed bamboo stick into its heart. They fill a bowl with the blood which squirts out and with this in their hands they approach the site of the mung, sprinkle some drops of blood on the place and recite the following. When this has been done they begin to prepare their fields. I was told that this ceremony is performed for all crops in fields which harbour a mung."
637,"Ceremonies to the mă yel beings. At Tingbung. According to rig zing, the Lepchas and also the Maharajah, perform ceremonies twice a year to the mă yel beings,—the first time when they have finished sowing seeds of paddy rice, and the second time after the harvesting of paddy rice. The proper time for making the initial preparation of the rice fields is indicated by the calls of various species of migratory cuckoos, supposed to have been sent by the mă yel beings to announce the arrival of the right moment. Then the Tingbung Lepchas taking a hen, a rupee, a fish, a wild bird, beaten rice, green leaves, tor ma, butter, and incense, gather in one of the houses, and perform an offering of these things to the mă yel rŭm, singing. In this ritual the rŭm, să kyŭ for paddy rice, să vi for millet and shă rŭng for maize are invoked. It is emphasised that it is just the right time for sowing, indicated by the condition of the soil and the phase of the moon. Both the rice and the millet are regarded as a family, the new seed of the millet being the daughter-in-law, and the new seed of the rice the son-in-law, while their grain are regarded as their children. The song finishes with the confident assurance that the coming harvest will be greater than that of last year: it will be both mother and child."
638,"Biannual Ceremony of the Tamgsangmu pŭ tsho. On a fixed date a male member of the pŭ tsho selects a red cock for the ceremony to be celebrated at the beginning of the next season. He cleans the beak and feet of the cock with water, and in the meantime the bong thíng is called in. When he arrives he prays to kong chen in approximately the following words. Today I consecrate this cock to you on behalf of Tamgsangmu pŭ tsho. Please take care of the family and protect it from sickness and misfortune until this cock is sacrificed at the next season. One morning very early before dawn, at the beginning of the next season, when the cock is to be sacrificed, the bong thíng is called in again. Meanwhile a cho kóng, a conical, ceremonial figure of rice, is moulded on a mat inside the house. The conical shape of this figure is meant to resemble a mountain peak, in this case the peak of kong chen. Three eggs are put in front of the cho kóng, and three pats of the yolk of a boiled egg are smeared on the front of the cho kóng. Then the cho kóng is carried to the top of a small hill from which kong chen can be seen. This must take place before sunrise. Next an altar is erected on the hill. For this purpose a square piece of ground is chosen, at the four corners of which a bamboo post is stuck into the earth. Then the mat is laid on top of the posts, each of its corners being tied to a post. The cho kóng is placed in the middle, facing kong chen. Finally a long bamboo staff carrying a red flag is tied to the left front post. Then the bong thíng asks a man to bring the consecrated cock and another man to clean its beak and feet. Standing in front of the altar and holding the cock in his hands, the bong thíng says approximately the following words: ‘To our promise we now bring you the cock that was consecrated six months ago’. He pours water on the cock's comb and puts rice on its head. Then he hands over the cock to one of the men and orders him to kill it. The man cuts the cock's throat, plucks and draws it, and cleans its body in water. Then the beak and the legs are cleaned in boiling water, the body is cooked, and mixed with cooked rice, the meat is served as a sacrificial meal on a plate that is placed in front of the cho kóng. The bong thíng now prays to kong chen. Immediately after this prayer the bong thíng crushes the shells of the three eggs put in front of the cho kóng, pours out carefully the yolks on a plate, and, examining thoroughly the surfaces of the yolks, he augurs the future of the pŭ tsho. That is the end of the ceremony; the sacrificial meal is now removed from the altar and eaten by the assembled members of the pŭ tsho."
639,"Biannual Ceremony of Female pŭ tsho. Tamsang told me that the female pŭ tsho have their own ceremony with the same procedure and with similar rites, but under the guidance of a female mŭn. The altar, however, is quite different. There are no posts and no flag, and the cho kóng is placed on a mat rolled out on the ground. This cho kóng is made of rice moulded into the shape of a large, cube with a slight, square hollow in the middle of the top. This hollow represents the ancestral Himalayan tarn from which the pŭ tsho originated. On each of the four edges of the hollow a pat of yolk is smeared."
640,"Ceremony for the New-born Child. The people of Tingbung celebrate a long ceremony on the third day after a childbirth. The family usually calls rig zing and the mother of kă lók, who is an old mŭn. Inside the house a small altar is arranged with a rupee, a hen, a vessel with cí, and a lamp, as gifts to na zong mŭ nyŭ. The purpose of the ceremony is to secure the child a long life and to protect it against diseases. At some time during the ceremony, when the family have sacrificed the hen and have presented the offering gifts to the gods, rig zing recites the following prayer. Despite the many obscure phrases, all of which even rig zing could not explain, the meaning of the prayer is obvious: it is a series of invocations of several rŭm for the protection of the child, and a series of petitions to several mung accompanied by a recital of what the people have done in order to prevent the influences of certain evil powers."
641,"First Wedding Ceremony: pă nol. The young man's parents now make the necessary preparations for the pă nol, collecting for the ceremony two loins of a pig or an ox, a big load of cí, 25 rupees, and a ceremonial scarf as gifts. When these things are ready, they have to be consecrated by a bong thíng or a mŭn before they are taken to the girl's parents. The consecration is performed in the following way: The gifts collected are placed in front of the bong thíng or the mŭn, incense is burnt, and cí and rice are offered to the gods. The officiant recites a long prayer of invocation to the gods, asking them to bless the wedding, to bestow happiness upon the young couple, and to make their union prosperous and fertile. When the consecration is over, they all consume a meal of rice and meat. The following day the go-between, the young man, and two men carrying the gifts set off for the house of the young man's future parents-in-law. When they arrive there, the suitor greets his prospective parents-in-law very courteously and stays with them for three days. On his departure he is presented with a gift of cí and meat."
642,"Second Wedding Ceremony: a shek. When the men return from the above visit, the family make arrangements for the considerable gifts called nyóm să a far, price, value of labour portion of produce given to assistant. the price of the bride, to be presented to the girl's parents as soon as possible after the first ceremony. The interval between the two ceremonies is often not more than a few days, and at all events a longer interval than a few weeks is not considered proper. When the gifts are ready, they are thoroughly examined and consecrated by the bong thíng or the mŭn, after which the whole family and the officiant sit down to enjoy a meal. When this is over a procession is formed for the purpose of taking the gifts to the bride's family. The procession consists of the following people. On their way to the house belonging to the bride's parents the members of the procession stop for a ceremonial drink of tea, called lóm thóng. When the party reach the bride's house, they are received by the bride's byek bo, go-between, who leads them into the house, where they take their seats according to their rank. The bride's party arranged according to rank and position sit facing the bridegroom's party, and between the two parties the two byek bo of the bridegroom and the bride will stand. Meanwhile cí is served to all the members of both parties. Thereafter the performance proper of the a shek, a marriage-gift made before marriage to parents of bride, as price value of the girl varying in demand according to the circumstances of the bridegroom. begins. While the milch cow and the young bull are kept outside, the brass pot, the two loins of ox or pig, the load of cí, the garment for the bride's mother, the bundle of cloth for the bride's father, the money and the scarves are placed before the bride's party on a large bamboo mat in order to be presented to the respective relatives of the bride. The bride is then led into the room and seated by the side of the bridegroom. Taking a ceremonial scarf in his hands the bridegroom's byek bo addresses the bride's party requesting them to accept the a shek. If the bride's party find the a shek satisfactory, they touch the gifts with their fingers as a token of acceptance, if not, there will be a great discussion, and the bridegroom's party may have to pay some extra money in order to supplement the a shek. The time has now arrived for the religious ceremony. The bong thíng or the mŭn consecrates the gifts, incense is burnt, rice is offered, and cí is offered from small cups smeared with butter. The officiant bong thíng or mŭn recites a long prayer invoking several gods and asking them to bless the young couple and to make their union fruitful and prosperous. They are pledged to be good to each other, and are given cí to drink from a consecrated cup smeared with butter. Thereafter the bridegroom's byek bo distributes the gifts, and the rest of the day and the following night are spent in feasting, singing, and dancing."
643,"Third Wedding Ceremony. Some months later the bride will be taken to the bridegroom's parents' house and the final wedding ceremony is performed. Before leaving her parents' house the bride is finely clothed and decorated with ornaments presented to her by her relatives. She is accompanied by a body of persons comprising her go-between, her paternal uncle, her paternal aunt, her maternal uncle, her maternal aunt, her brother, some other near relatives, her close friends and some people from the village. They carry with them a load of cí and a slaughtered pig. On the way members of the bridegroom's family will provide them with lóm thóng, tea-on-the-way. On arriving at the house belonging to the bridegroom's parents they are welcomed by the bridegroom's byek bo and conducted inside. When the bride enters the house, the bridegroom's mother steps forward and receives her by putting a bangle, called nyóm tŭk víl, vb. to fetter, to chain, deriv. tŭk-víl s. chains, fetters, fastening. the bride's chains, on the wrist of her right hand as a token that she is accepted as a daughter-in-law. At the same time this small ceremony implies that from that day she is locked up in the family. At each side of the entrance door some jugs full of water and two loads of dry wood are kept. Before entering the house all the attendants of the bride have to dip the middle finger and the thumb of their right hand into the water and to throw some drops towards the sky. But the bride must carry a jug full of water and two pieces of wood from each load into the house. She puts the pieces of wood on the burning hearth, and she pours the water into a big pot which has been kept on the hearth for the purpose of boiling water for preparing cí. Then she calls the gods of the hearth, of the fire and of the water to witness that from today she has become a member of the family. When the bride's attendants have taken their seats, cí is served, and the bridegroom's relatives place their presents before the bride's attendants, thereby indicating their acceptance of the bride. Meanwhile the bridegroom and the bride sit together. Thereafter the bride's byek bo takes a scarf in one hand and a rupee in the other and addresses the bride as follows: ‘You have now been married into such and such pŭ tsho, and you are now bound to them and have no connection with any people other than the members of this pŭ tsho. In the beginning tar bong bo and na rip nom instituted and organised the marriage, and today we celebrate the wedding accordingly. Now you are bound! So saying, the bride's byek bo hangs the scarf round the bride's bowed neck and puts the rupee into her hand. He then resumes his seat. Thereafter the bride's paternal uncle stands up and addresses the members of the bridegroom's party as follows: ‘We are giving this girl of ours to such and such pŭ tsho. If you are not good to her, we shall take her back and we shall punish you’. Then the bridegroom's paternal uncle stands up and expressing elaborate thanks to the bride's attendants he says:’ From today the bride will be our daughter, and the bridegroom will be your son!’ And he promises solemnly that the bride will be treated well, and that they will try their best to make her happy. Then a second round of cí, rice, meat and vegetables is served. The bridegroom and the bride sit together and enjoy their meals from the same plate and drink their cí from the same cup. The bride is served zo gul consisting of different sorts of meat on top of which is put a roast cock. She does not eat the cock, but sends it to her mother signifying that she has now been fully accepted as a bride, and that she has been recognised as a member of her new family."
644,"The Common Meal. On the last day of the old year all the members of the family, the father and mother, their children, the sons-in-law, the daughters-in-law, and the grandchildren assemble in the house of the family. Any male member of the family who has moved away from the house of the old parents will join them. If the old parents are not alive, the members of the family will assemble in the house belonging to the eldest brother. The mŭn and the bong thíng will also be present. Then a big ox or a big pig is killed, and the bong thíng and the mŭn offer the cooked meat of the animal, rice, and cí to “the Good Spirit”. This offering must take place before noon. Afterwards the members of the family eat the meat and drink cí prepared specially for this occasion."
645,"The Ceremonial Figure of the Old Year. In the afternoon the bong thíng and the mŭn mould some rice into the shape of a figure representing the old year, place the figure on a large, round basket, and decorate it with various kinds of leaves and grasses. The bong thíng also makes a small pot of moulded rice and puts some butter and a twig into it in order to use it as a lamp in front of the figure. When it is beginning to get dark the bong thíng decides on the auspicious time for the carrying away of the figure. The mŭn falls into a trance, and she, too, chants the auspicious time for the carrying away of the figure, and in addition she gives information about the direction in which the figure must be carried. At the auspicious time the figure is moved into the middle of the room and placed facing the main door, and the bong thíng and the mŭn take their seats quite close to it. The mŭn chants, thanking “the Good Spirit” for bestowing happiness, prosperity, and peace upon the household, and for the protection of the family from illness, famine, etc. Sprinkling cí from a cup smeared with butter she prays to “the Good Spirit” requesting it in the year to come to bestow happiness, prosperity, and peace upon the family. Purification of the Members of the Family. Then the mŭn rises to her feet and takes two bunches of twigs and a thorny stick to which is tied a rupee. While the members of the family are sitting in front of the figure, she makes some sweeping movements with the twigs and the sticks along their bodies. She begins with the father and several times sweeps his head, shoulders, body, and legs, continually making the sweeping movements from above downwards. At the same time she prophesies that she now sweeps away not only the evil effects of unlucky days of the dying year, but also the misfortunes which during the old year have rested upon him, and which would still burden his life. She assures him that from now on these evils will be transmitted to the figure. Finally she declares him purified. Then she turns to the next member of the family performing the same ceremony, and in this way she purifies all the persons one by one. The bong thíng then rises and puts a handful of rice into the hands of each member of the family asking them to clench their fists in order that the imprints of their hands will be left clearly on the moulded rice. He then goes up to the father, takes his two pieces of moulded rice with the imprints of his hands, and says a prayer mentioning the name of the father and the name of the year in which he was born. He touches the old man's head, shoulders, and legs, first on the right side, then on the left side, orders him to spit on the two pieces of moulded rice with the imprints of his hands, and asks him to put them in front of the figure. Finally he declares that all the evils, misfortunes, diseases, etc. which have plagued him during the old year, will now leave him and pass over to the figure. Then he proceeds to all the other members of the family and purifies them in turn in the same way. This procedure may take quite a long time. The Casting out of the Evil and the Old Year. The bong thíng takes a basket full of powder made of buckwheat, rice, beans, maize, pulse, etc. and spreads the powder on the floor in a line like a path from the figure to the main door. He then selects among the assembled people a number of young men, taking care that the names of their years of birth do not coincide with the names of any of the three previous years and the three coming years. It is the duty of these young men to carry away the figure, which is now loaded with all the evil powers which have plagued the members of the family. He therefore instructs them meticulously about the direction in which they must go. The Lepchas also believe that a great number of mung will disappear along the powder-path, following the figure. When the young men have carried the figure out of the house, a girl sweeps the floor, throws the powder outside the house, and closes the main door carefully. It is a common belief that when the powder has been thrown outside, the mung will be unable to find their way back to the house. When the girl has closed the door, the assembled people sit in silence waiting for the young men to return. On arriving they knock on the door, and the bong thíng and the mŭn rise immediately and taking a pot full of cí and some embers from the hearth, they open the door and throw outside some of the contents of the pot. On entering the young men must touch the embers with their hands and feet, while the mŭn sprinkles them with drops of cí. By touching the embers the mung, following the young men, will be scared away, and the sprinkling with cí purifies the young men of the evil effects of their contact with the figure. In this way the ceremony prevents anything evil being carried into the house."
646,"The Second Day of the New Year. Very early before dawn all the members of the family take a bath and put on new clothes. Before sunrise they assemble in front of the house altar, and while the head of the family burns candles and incense, they all sit down in a group praying for health, prosperity, and peace in the year to come. A special cup full of cí and smeared on the rim with three lumps of butter has been kept on the altar. It is now taken down by the head of the family who sprinkles cí three times towards the sky, and then drinks a little of it. Small pats of butter are then taken from the lumps on the rim of the cup and put on the foreheads of all present. If there are any babies in the family, the mother will also put her fingers into the cup and sprinkle some drops of cí into the mouths of the babies. Thereafter the head of the family distributes presents to all of them, and the old members of the family give presents to the younger ones, and the younger ones to the still younger ones. Finally all the younger people bow down before the old people asking for their blessing. Then they all sit down in the large room in order to enjoy a meal in common. But first the head of the family sacrifices food to the gods, and says a prayer. He also takes a small quantity of rice and curry from everybody's dish, puts it on a large banana leaf, offers it to the mung, and throws it outside. Thereafter they can enjoy their meal, joking and laughing. When the meal is over, they leave the house to visit their neighbours, to greet them, to wish them a happy New Year, and to ask them for their blessing. All the villagers pay a special visit to the headman, taking with them as presents a ceremonial scarf, a loin of pork, and a big load of cí. The headman in return presents them with a lavish meal and entertains them. Tamsang, who is himself a headman, says that he usually gives the villagers a good meal of rice and curry prepared with spices, and several Indian, Tibetan and Chinese dishes and sweets, and sometimes tinned foods, and various favourite drinks. If they are accompanied by children, he presents the children with money and sweets"
647,"The Initial Ceremony. The initial ceremony takes place in the palace grounds at Gangtok. Headed by the priest about twenty men set out from Tingbung and walk to Gangtok. In the palace grounds the Maharajah (or his representative?) receives them, presenting them with a yak, some pieces of cloth, some rice, and some cí. While still in the palace grounds they decorate the horns of the yak with the pieces of cloth, and presenting it with the rice and some money, they join the priest in the following prayer which he recites in front of the yak. In this brief opening prayer the main points of the entire kong chen ceremony immediately come to the fore: The invocation of the rŭm, i. e. kong chen; the threefold request to kong chen that they may not be infested with diseases; the Maharajah's participation in the ceremony by donating the sacrificial animal; the people's presentation of the sacrificial animal to kong chen; and the final prayer to kong chen to accept the sacrifice. The words “the sky and the sun” (4) are a current honorific term for the Maharajah. The Procession from Gangtok to the hla thu Shrine. Thereafter the men set out in procession to the hla thu of Tingbung: the yak is led at the head of the procession, followed by the priest, and after him the other Lepchas. Some men are equipped with drums and bells, playing as an orchestra in honour of the yak, while now and again young men perform ceremonious steps as a processional dance. Not only the arrangement of the procession, but also the persons acting in it, characterise the entire performance as a very holy undertaking. From time to time the priest intones a holy and secret hymn (cf. p. 192) in a low murmuring voice, the men joining him by raising their voices at the end of each line. This hymn is simple and monotonous, but rich in references to Lepcha mythology. The Nocturnal Ceremony in the Priest's House, a great body of men have assembled in the altar room of the priest's house, and during the following night a ceremony will be celebrated here by the priest. They light the butter lamps and, while prostrate in front of the altar, the priest recites the following prayer. This prayer is an invocation of kong chen and kóng lo on behalf of the Maharajah entreating them to prevent the mung mentioned from doing any harm to the Maharajah. All the obscure phrases and names refer to mung or to neighbouring peoples supposed to be governed by mung; among these are enumerated the Bhutanese king, the Nepalese, and the Limbus; peoples with whom the Lepchas have had quarrels or wars during the last centuries."
648,"The Sacrifice of the Yak at the hla thu Shrine. Very early next morning the people from Tingbung gather at hla thu bringing cí and rice, and soon the priest arrives accompanied by the men who have joined him in the night ceremony in his house. They bring the spear, the big elephant tusk, a tor ma, pieces of cloth, small altar vessels, and the gun from the priest's house. The priest decorates the yak with pieces of cloth, while some prayer flags, which have been presented by the Maharajah, are hung in the top of one of the trees. The priest then arranges the bamboo platform as a provisional altar with the tor ma, the vessels, and some other pieces of cloth. He then smears small lumps of butter on the tops of the stones of the shrine, fills the vessels with a mixture of rice and cí, steps forward, and throwing rice and cí into the air he recites the following prayer. The meaning of this prayer, imploring protection, is obvious. The priest requests kong chen not to cause any harm or trouble to the Maharajah, but to give him a long life; he beseeches kong chen not to cause any illness to come upon the cattle and the people, but to give them a peaceful life; and he emphasises that today they have given tribute to kong chen and offerings of first-fruits to his wife. When the priest has finished his prayer, a man, naked to the waist, steps forward, ready to kill the yak. This act is his particular duty, he has been appointed to it by the Maharajah, and he performs it every year. He grasps the spear, which has been brought from the priest's house, and thrusts it into the heart of the yak. The Lepchas say that no drop of blood gushing out will fall to the ground, but all the blood will disappear immediately and completely—an omen that the sacrifice has been accepted. When the yak has died, some men hastily skin it, cut open the body, and cutting a piece from each important part of the body, they collect these pieces and boil them. The priest then steps forward, takes these pieces, and mixing them with rice and with blood from the yak, he moulds them into small lumps. While invoking the supernatural beings, one by one, he throws the lumps into the air, requesting the rŭm and the mung to accept the sacrifice. The Common Meal on the Remainder of the Yak and the Priest's Final Prayer. The people collected now enjoy a common meal on the remainder of the rice and the meat, and drink what is left of the cí, but everybody always throws something of his meal and some drops of his cí into the air as gifts to the supernatural beings. When the meal is over the people depart and return to their houses, each of them taking some pieces of meat with him for the members of his family. The priest receives the head, the hide of the yak, and some selected pieces of meat as his share. He goes to his house altar, lights some lamps, burns incense, and prays to kong chen. I did not succeed in obtaining the wording of this prayer, but I was told that he asks kong chen not to cause him trouble, pain and damage in the year to come between now and the celebration of the ceremony the next year."
649,"The haircutting ceremony (haqīqa) , occurs on the seventh or fortieth day after a child is born. This is his first religious act. He gives gold-dust, equivalent in weight to his shaved-off hair, as alms to the poor. This event is celebrated by the sacrifice of a sheep or goat, providing meat for a feast to which thirty to forty men are invited, most of them as members of the local association."
650,"The ceremony of ‘going and fetching’ (wra ) which is a collective term for what happens to and around the groom. The groom arrives at a certain place, where the important old people are sitting; he comes from his home in his new clothes and stands facing Mecca, the praying direction (qibla ), his turban is put on and soon afterwards, all the men walk with the groom to the bride's tent, taking with them a nicely decorated camel. A sitting place may be prepared for the group outside the bride's tent. The village barber (who has previously acted as cook and/or musician) spreads a handkerchief on the ground and one by one, a person from each household puts money in it for the groom and the barber calls out: 'So and so puts in so much money; may his house prosper'. The announcement ensures that everyone knows what each person has given so that the groom may reciprocate by giving the same amount or more at the giver's marriage or other occasion. The mother-in-law now calls the groom to the tent and the women sing. The mother-in-law kisses him and the other women throw sweets over him. This is accompanied by songs specific to the occasion. Then the bride, completely hidden in a silk headcloth, is led out of the tent and seated on the camel. The camel is led by the groom (as I was told) or by the groom's mother's brother (as I have witnessed). A whole procession of tambourine playing and dancing women accompanies the camel. At the same time the men follow firing their guns. At a certain distance from the encampment, the bride's party bids farewell, while the groom's party sings about the sorrow of the father who has to leave his daughter behind. On arriving at the bridegroom's encampment, the party is greeted with congratulations. The camel is led to the groom's parents' tent; the bride is helped down and taken inside; the men stand in front of the bride and give her money, and the bride's mother gives gifts to the men. During this ceremony the bride is completely hidden in her big head cloth."
651,"Three days after the birth, the child was given its ner, or personal name. This ceremony was called the ug aana (washing) and was not as important as the hair-cutting ceremony which came at the age of 3. Usually a lama was invited to perform the rites, and the ceremony was attended by close relatives on both sides of the family. Before the service conducted by the lama, the child was washed in a meat broth, probably by its own mother or its father's mother. After this it was washed in arasaan (holy water) by the lama. Again, no relatives other than the female who holds the child during the preliminary washing in meat broth have any special functions at this ceremony."
